# Implementation Plan — 首个安全提取

## Step 1 — 建立模块

- [x] 在 `src-tauri/src/chat/mod.rs` 声明私有 `mcp_image_feedback` 模块。
- [x] 新建 `src-tauri/src/chat/mcp_image_feedback.rs`。

## Step 2 — 移动纯实现

- [x] 原样移动 `append_tool_result_note`。
- [x] 原样移动 `image_extension_for_mime`。
- [x] 原样移动 `data_url_image_part`。
- [x] 使用 `pub(super)` 控制可见性。
- [x] 在 `commands.rs` 添加最小 import，并删除原定义。

## Step 3 — 下沉测试

- [x] 移动 MCP 图片辅助测试和 `image_artifact` fixture helper。
- [x] 清理 `commands.rs` 测试模块中只为这些测试存在的引用。
- [x] 保持测试数据和断言语义不变。

## Step 4 — 验证

- [x] `rustfmt --edition 2021 --check --config skip_children=true src-tauri/src/chat/mcp_image_feedback.rs`
- [x] 运行 7 个 MCP 图片辅助单元测试（名称过滤或逐项过滤）。
- [x] `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- [x] `git diff --check`
- [x] 审查 diff，确认 `mcp/registry.rs`、公开入口和业务编排无变化。

## Step 5 — 记录下一刀

- [x] 根据本次结果记录完整 MCP 图片编排迁移需要先建立的视觉服务边界，不在本提交中实施。
## Step 6 — 建立共享模型调用边界

- [x] 迁移 `read_image_as_tool_result` 和 MCP artifact 编排实现。
- [x] 在 `commands.rs` 保留原签名薄代理。
- [x] 确认 `vision.rs`、`model_call.rs` 不 import `commands`。

## Step 8 — 下沉测试并完成最终验证

- [x] 运行 `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`。
- [x] 运行 `git diff --check`。
- [x] 检查 MCP registry 兼容入口和新模块依赖方向。

## Step 9 — 文档与最终审查

- [x] 更新 `verification.md`。
- [x] 更新 `.trellis/spec/chat/mcp-image-feedback.md` 中的实现位置和模块边界。
- [x] 审查完整 diff，确认仅包含模块移动、最小 import/代理和任务文档。
- [x] 用户已确认继续拆分，已完成首轮 commit。

## Step 10 — 连续拆分：catalog / CRUD 模块（第二轮）

- [x] 新建 `src-tauri/src/chat/commands/catalog.rs`。
- [x] 迁移 conversation 查询/创建/导入、assistant CRUD/builder、project CRUD、set CRUD。
- [x] 迁移相关 prompt/context helper 与 `ExternalConversationMessage`。
- [x] `commands.rs` 仅保留后续编排所需的私有 import，以及 `create_assistant_via_builder` 兼容 re-export。
- [x] Tauri 注册改为 Rust 模块实际路径 `chat::commands::catalog::*`，前端 command 名保持不变。
- [x] 定向 rustfmt、`cargo check`、相关 6 个单元测试和 `git diff --check` 通过。
- [x] 提交本轮，并在提交后复跑验证。

## Step 11 — 后续模块边界

- [ ] 每轮只提取一个可独立验证的职责边界。
- [ ] 每轮执行：实现 → 定向检查/测试 → Git commit → 提交后复测。
- [ ] 继续拆分 context、session、attachments、reply/messages、tooling/agent host、conversation mutations 与 tests。
- [ ] 最终将 `commands.rs` 收敛为模块门面，并执行全范围验证。
