# Chat Agent Runtime

> Module layout (since 2026-06-12 split, zero behavior change): `loop_.rs` is a thin orchestration skeleton (`LoopEnv`/`RunState` + prepare → planning → tool rounds → synthesis → finalize). Planning + provider-call plumbing live in `planning.rs`, tool round scheduling in `rounds.rs`, synthesis paths in `synthesis.rs`, and `RunResultBuilder` + fallback copy + `SegmentBuilder` in `finalize.rs`. Loop tests live in `loop_tests.rs` (mounted via `#[path]` from `loop_.rs`). All contracts below are unchanged by the split; `run_agent_loop` remains the single public entry. Fallback behavior (synthesis failure/cancel/empty, planning draft failure) is pinned by regression tests in `loop_tests.rs` — keep them green and assertion-identical through refactors.

## Scenario: In-Loop Context Compaction

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes to `chat/agent/compaction.rs`, the `maybe_compact_send_view` call sites in `planning.rs` / `synthesis.rs`, or anything that alters what the provider receives vs. what is persisted on long tool-loop runs.
- Long tool chains grow `state.runtime_messages` unboundedly; without in-loop governance the run eventually exceeds the model window and errors instead of self-healing.

### 2. Signatures

- `compaction::maybe_compact_send_view(env: &LoopEnv, state: &mut RunState) -> Vec<Value>` — async; returns the message view to SEND for this step.
- `compaction::snip_old_tool_results(messages, keep_recent, snip_threshold) -> Vec<Value>` — pure, borrow-only Layer 1.
- Constants: `KEEP_RECENT_RAW_MESSAGES = 8`, `SNIP_THRESHOLD_CHARS = 4000`, `COMPACT_TRIGGER_RATIO = 0.85`.

### 3. Contracts

- Both `planning_step` and `synthesis_step` build their request from `maybe_compact_send_view`, not from `state.runtime_messages` directly. (This also unified a historical quirk where non-stream synthesis sent the raw runtime messages.)
- Under budget (`estimate_messages_tokens ≤ window × ratio`, window from `context_window_for_model`): return a verbatim clone — zero behavior change. `window == 0` disables compaction.
- **Layer 1 (free)**: outside the last `KEEP_RECENT_RAW_MESSAGES` messages, `role == "tool"` contents over `SNIP_THRESHOLD_CHARS` chars are replaced by head-half + `[... N chars snipped ...]` + tail-quarter (char-boundary safe). Affects the send view only; `state.runtime_messages` is NOT written.
- **Layer 2 (one model call)**: only if still over budget after snip. Old segment (between the leading system prefix and the protected tail) is clipped to 500 chars/message and summarized via `call_chat_completion_message` (no tools), raced against `wait_for_generation_inactive` — cancellation abandons compaction and returns the snip view. On success the summary replaces the old segment as a `user`(summary)/`assistant`(ack) pair (keeps role alternation legal) and **is written back to `state.runtime_messages`** so later rounds don't re-summarize. On any failure: log + degrade to the snip view; compaction must never fail the run.
- `state.generated_api_messages` (the persistence mirror for replay/tool cards) is NEVER touched by either layer. Snip markers and summaries must not appear in persisted messages.
- No `AgentHost` trait or frontend event changes; the context bar refreshes from the existing post-reply `compute_context_state`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Window unknown (0) | No compaction; verbatim send view. |
| Under trigger ratio | Verbatim send view (byte-identical messages). |
| Over ratio, snip suffices | Snipped send view; runtime/persisted state untouched. |
| Still over after snip | Layer 2 summary; on success rewrite `runtime_messages` (work copy only). |
| Summary call fails / empty / cancelled | Degrade to snip view; the run continues. |

### 5. Tests Required

- Pure: snip truncates only old oversized tool messages (marker + char count), protects recent/non-tool/under-threshold, multibyte-safe; summary split protects system prefix and recent tail; summary replacement keeps `system,user,assistant,…` role legality.
- Integration (MockModelServer body capture): over-budget run sends snipped bodies while `result.api_messages` keep raw content; Layer-2 run fires the summary request first, the next request carries the summary and recent history but not the old raw text, and the summary never appears in `api_messages`; under-budget run sends bodies verbatim.

## Scenario: Per-Round Tool Scheduling

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes under `src-tauri/src/chat/agent/**` that alter how model-emitted tool calls are matched, executed, recorded, or replayed.
- The Chat agent loop is a Rust-native model-step loop. Provider adapters may parse multiple tool calls from one assistant response, but local execution concurrency is controlled by the runtime scheduler.

### 2. Signatures

- `run_agent_loop(config, host, executor) -> Result<AgentRunResult, String>`
- `execute_tool_call(host, executor, settings, ctx, tool, call, skill_cache) -> (ToolCallRecord, String)`
- `validate_tool_arguments(tool, arguments) -> Result<(), String>`
- `ToolExecutor::call(ctx, tool, arguments, skill_cache) -> ToolExecutorFuture`
- `skill_cache` is optional so non-skill tools can run without borrowing the per-run `SkillRunCache`.
- `ChatToolDefinition` must carry `input_schema`, optional MCP `annotations`, optional MCP `output_schema`, and `sensitive`.
- `ToolCallRecord` must carry lifecycle fields plus optional `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `structured_content`.

### 3. Contracts

- Record one assistant message containing all requested `tool_calls` before appending any tool result messages.
- Append generated tool result messages as OpenAI-compatible objects:

```json
{ "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "<original id>", "content": "<tool output>" }
```

- Tool result messages must remain in the same order as the model's original `PendingToolCall` list, even if execution completes out of order.
- Every executable tool still emits lifecycle records through `AgentHost::emit_tool_record`: pending, running, then final success/error/skipped/cancelled.
- Validate every executable tool call against `ChatToolDefinition.input_schema` before approval and before `ToolExecutor::call`. Validation failure returns an error tool result and must not ask for approval or invoke the executor.
- Approval-gated tools must be serial. Do not start execution before `AgentHost::request_tool_approval` resolves.
- The native parallel-safe set is intentionally narrow: `native:web_search`, `native:web_fetch`, `native:read_file` (plus the read-side project tools `list_dir`/`search_files`/`glob_files`/`stat_path`), and `native:agent`, and only when `tool_requires_approval` returns false. `agent` qualifies because each spawn runs in isolation (its own synthetic conversation/generation/message history), bypasses approval, and is capped by the SubAgentManager `Semaphore(3)` — so concurrent fan-out is the core multi-agent value.
- MCP tools are serial by default. A MCP tool may join a parallel batch only when it has explicit `annotations.readOnlyHint == true`, no `destructiveHint == true`, and `tool_requires_approval` returns false.
- MCP approval/sensitivity must prefer tool metadata over name guessing: `destructiveHint == true`, `openWorldHint == true`, or `readOnlyHint == false` imply sensitive/confirmation behavior under confirm policies; `readOnlyHint == true` allows auto-approval for trusted non-sensitive tools. User-selected `approval_policy == "auto"` still bypasses approval prompts but must not make non-read-only MCP tools parallel.
- Preserve MCP metadata across all backend/frontend boundaries: `annotations`, `outputSchema`, and tool result `structuredContent` must not be dropped. When a MCP result includes `structuredContent`, persist it on `ToolCallRecord` and include it in the model-facing tool content unless the text result already contains the same JSON.
- Tool records emitted from the agent loop should include `trace_id = run_id` and a deterministic `span_id` such as `tool_round_<round>_<tool_call_id>` so future tracing/export can correlate events without changing storage shape.
- Provider-streamed tool call chunks are real runtime state. When `ToolCallStart` arrives during tool planning, the backend must emit a backend-owned tool segment plus a pending `ToolCallRecord`; as argument deltas arrive it may update the same record with a compact progress preview, and when `ToolCallDone` arrives normal tool execution should continue with the same `tool_call_id`.
- Serial by default: writes/edits, command execution, `run_python`, Skill runtime tools, Mixer image generation, memory mutation, arbitrary MCP tools, unknown calls, and invalid arguments.
- `ask_user` is a native blocking clarification tool. It is allowed in Plan mode, bypasses sensitive tool approval, must stay serial, and must flush any pending parallel batch before waiting for the user's answer.
- `ask_user` must persist `ToolCallRecord.structured_content.askUser` with `phase`, original `questions`, and final `answers`; emit `chat-user-prompt` while awaiting; resolve through `chat_submit_user_choice`; and append a stable matching `role: tool` result using the original `tool_call_id`.
- Cancelling or timing out an awaiting `ask_user` must remove the pending prompt entry and produce a deterministic `cancelled` or `timeout` tool result so provider replay remains valid.
- Keep `SkillRunCache` on the serial path unless it is redesigned as a shared concurrency-safe cache with tests.
- Keep timeout and cancellation inside `execute_tool_call`; schedulers should call this helper rather than duplicating lifecycle logic.
- If generation is cancelled during a tool round, stop launching any unstarted calls in that round. Append ordered `cancelled` tool result messages and records for every unstarted call so provider replay remains valid.
- A cancelled tool round that already produced tool transcript messages should return an `AgentRunResult` with stopped content instead of bubbling `Err("cancelled")`, allowing the assistant message and tool records to persist.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Unknown enabled tool name | Emit an error `ToolCallRecord`; append a matching `role: tool` error message. |
| Disabled built-in requested through fallback markup | Append hidden model feedback; do not emit a visible tool record. |
| Invalid tool argument JSON | Emit an error `ToolCallRecord`; append retry guidance as the tool result; do not request approval or call the executor. |
| Tool arguments violate declared schema | Emit an error `ToolCallRecord`; append schema retry guidance; do not request approval or call the executor. |
| MCP `annotations.readOnlyHint == true` and trusted/non-sensitive | May skip approval under confirm policies and may parallelize if no other risk hints are present. |
| MCP `destructiveHint == true`, `openWorldHint == true`, or `readOnlyHint == false` | Treat as sensitive under confirm policies; keep serial even if approval is skipped by `"auto"`. |
| Tool requires approval | Execute serially after approval; skipped result if denied. |
| MCP result includes `structuredContent` | Preserve it on the tool record, emit it through `chat-tool`, and include it in replay content without duplicating identical text JSON. |
| `ask_user` awaiting answer | Emit inline prompt state, block the same run until answer/skip/cancel/timeout, then append the answer JSON as the tool result. |
| Generation cancelled while a tool is running | Mark active and unstarted tool records cancelled where possible, append matching tool result messages in original order, and stop launching remaining calls. |
| Tool timeout | Mark the tool record error and return the timeout message as tool content. |
| Provider stream fails after a visible tool-call draft starts but before executable arguments are complete | Mark the draft `ToolCallRecord` error, preserve its tool segment, and return an `AgentRunResult` with `stream_outcome = "error"` instead of bubbling an invoke error that clears the conversation turn. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a model emits `read_file` and `web_fetch` in one round; both enter running state before either finishes, but replay messages preserve model order.
- Good: a trusted MCP server exposes two tools with `readOnlyHint: true`; both may overlap, and their `structuredContent` remains visible in records/events/model replay.
- Good: a model emits `read_file`, `ask_user`, then `web_fetch`; the read finishes first, `ask_user` waits inline for the user's answer, and `web_fetch` starts only after the answer tool result is ready.
- Good: a model starts streaming `write_file` arguments for a long generated file; the UI shows a backend-emitted pending tool record while arguments are being generated, and if the provider stream times out before `ToolCallDone`, the tool record becomes error without losing the user/assistant turn.
- Base: a model emits only `run_python`; calls execute one at a time and keep old lifecycle behavior.
- Bad: a scheduler parallelizes `skill_activate` or an arbitrary MCP stdio tool without explicit read-only annotations and races shared state or external side effects.
- Bad: a scheduler includes `ask_user` in a parallel batch, allowing later tools to run before the user's answer has entered the transcript.
- Bad: schema validation happens inside one executor implementation only; other executors can still receive invalid arguments or approval prompts can show invalid payloads.

### 6. Tests Required

- Prove two eligible tools overlap by recording start/finish events.
- Prove explicitly read-only MCP tools overlap while destructive/open-world/non-read-only MCP tools remain serial.
- Prove returned `response_messages` and persisted `tool_records` follow original call order.
- Prove schema-invalid arguments produce error records and never call the executor or approval hook.
- Prove streamed tool-call start/delta/done events emit backend-owned tool draft records and tool segments before execution.
- Prove MCP `annotations`, `outputSchema`, and result `structuredContent` survive parse/registry/command/TypeScript boundaries.
- Prove serial-only tools never overlap.
- Prove `ask_user` remains allowed in Plan mode and remains serial between parallel-safe tools.
- Prove unknown and invalid calls flush pending parallel batches and preserve result ordering.
- Run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml chat::agent:: -- --nocapture` for targeted changes.
- Run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` before completion when practical.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
for call in tool_calls {
    tokio::spawn(execute_any_tool(call));
}
```

This loses transcript order, approval sequencing, cache safety, and cancellation ownership.

```rust
request_tool_approval(ctx, record).await;
validate_tool_arguments(tool, &call.arguments)?;
```

This can ask the user to approve a payload that will never execute and makes guardrail behavior inconsistent.

#### Correct

```rust
// Validate first, classify next, run only explicitly safe read-only tools together,
// then append all result messages in original model-call order.
```

Keep provider-side multiple tool-call support separate from local execution concurrency.

## Scenario: Assistant Timeline Segments

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes that alter Chat assistant message storage, `chat-stream` payloads, streaming preview state, final assistant replay, or frontend assistant rendering.
- Assistant output is a time-ordered timeline, not three independent buckets. Runtime text, reasoning, and tool calls must be representable as interleaved `segments`.

### 2. Signatures

- Persistent model: `ChatMessage.segments: Vec<ChatMessageSegment>` with `#[serde(default)]` for old conversations.
- Segment shape: `ChatMessageSegment { id, kind, phase, order, step_number?, round?, text?, tool_call_id? }`.
- Segment enums:
  - `kind`: `text | reasoning | tool`
  - `phase`: `auxiliary | plain | tool_loop | synthesis`
- Runtime result: `AgentRunResult.segments` and `AgentStepResult.segments`.
- Stream host: `AgentHost::emit_stream_delta(..., segment: Option<&ChatMessageSegment>)`.
- Tauri event: `chat-stream` includes `segmentId`, `segmentKind`, `phase`, `order`, `stepNumber`, `round`, `toolCallId`, and full `segment`.

### 3. Contracts

- The backend is the source of truth for segment order. The frontend must not synthesize guessed tool segments from `chat-tool` progress events.
- Streaming tool-call preparation segments are also backend-owned. Frontend rendering may update the matching tool record from `chat-tool`, but it must not create a separate inferred segment when provider tool-call deltas arrive.
- `SegmentBuilder` starts assistant-runtime segment ordering at `1000`. Auxiliary tool segments may use lower orders such as `100`.
- Planning/tool-loop narration uses `kind = text`, `phase = tool_loop`. Final answer text uses `phase = synthesis` when tools are involved, otherwise `plain`.
- Reasoning is represented by `kind = reasoning` segments and may appear during tool loop or synthesis. Within the same model step, reasoning must display before that step's text; reserve reasoning segments before text segments and keep frontend rendering compatible with older persisted messages that had the reverse order.
- Tool calls must get `kind = tool` segments before or alongside visible tool progress. Visible skipped, cancelled, blocked, auxiliary, unknown, and invalid tool calls still need tool segments so the timeline has no holes.
- Long-running tool argument generation is visible before execution: `ToolCallStart` should create a `kind = tool` segment and a pending tool record even though the tool has not executed yet. The label should distinguish argument/content generation from actual file mutation execution.
- Hidden disabled built-in feedback such as disabled `web_search` retry hints must not create visible tool segments when it does not create a visible `ToolCallRecord`.
- Persisted legacy fields are derived by `push_assistant_message` / edit helpers:
  - `content` is the `\n\n` join of all non-empty `kind = text` segments whose phase is `plain` or `synthesis`.
  - `reasoning` is the `\n\n` join of all non-empty `kind = reasoning` segments.
  - `tool_calls` remains the full record list in runtime/model order.
- `model_messages` for storage must use the same final legacy content/reasoning and preserve the tool transcript. Editing an assistant final answer must replace only final `plain`/`synthesis` text segments and rewrite replay messages to the edited final answer.
- Streaming and persisted rendering share the same segment shape. `chat-tool` events update tool record state only; `chat-stream` segment fields update timeline layout.
- Finish must not blank the assistant preview before persisted content is available. If `done` is delayed until after the invoke response, the frontend should patch from the returned conversation or await the pending done handler before clearing the snapshot.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Old assistant message has no `segments` | Deserialize successfully; synthesize fallback segments from `content`, `reasoning`, and `tool_calls` when rewriting or normalizing. |
| Runtime result has content/reasoning but no matching final segment | `normalize_assistant_segments` appends a final text/reasoning segment before save. |
| Tool record has no matching tool segment | `normalize_assistant_segments` appends a tool segment with `auxiliary` for round `0`/Mixer or `tool_loop` otherwise. |
| Plan-mode blocked or approval-denied tool is skipped/cancelled | Persist and stream a visible tool segment plus the matching `ToolCallRecord`. |
| Disabled built-in fallback feedback is hidden | Append model-facing feedback only; do not emit a visible segment or record. |
| Assistant final answer is edited | Preserve prior tool-loop text/reasoning/tool segments, replace final text segments, clear stale `api_messages`, and rewrite `model_messages`. |
| Stream `done` arrives after invoke success | Do not create an empty preview; finish from the returned persisted conversation or the pending done handler. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: model narrates a plan, calls `read_file`, narrates another step, then writes a synthesis. The UI renders text -> tool -> text -> final in the same order during streaming and after reload.
- Good: auxiliary vision analysis runs before the main model. It appears as an auxiliary tool segment before the main assistant timeline.
- Base: old messages without `segments` still render with the legacy tool/reasoning/content fallback.
- Bad: frontend receives `chat-tool` and inserts a guessed tool segment based on arrival time, causing stream order to differ from persisted order.
- Bad: save writes only `segments` and leaves legacy `content` stale, so copy/export/replay uses the wrong final answer.
- Bad: send/regenerate clears streaming preview in `finally` before reload or returned conversation has been applied, causing a blank frame.

### 6. Tests Required

- Serde compatibility: old assistant JSON without `segments` loads successfully.
- Legacy derivation: `content_from_segments` joins only `plain`/`synthesis` text; `reasoning_from_segments` joins reasoning segments.
- Segment normalization: auxiliary and skipped/cancelled tool records receive matching tool segments.
- Stream order: visible tool segments are produced from model-call order and hidden disabled built-ins are excluded.
- Edit replay: editing an assistant reply rewrites replay to the edited final answer while preserving tool transcript output.
- Frontend type/build: `npm run typecheck` verifies `chat-stream` segment payloads and `MessageBubble` timeline rendering props.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
api.onChatTool((payload) => {
  snapshot.segments.push(makeToolSegmentFromArrivalTime(payload))
})
```

This makes streaming layout depend on event timing instead of the model/tool-call order saved by the backend.

```rust
message.segments = segments;
message.content = content;
```

This can leave legacy fields, replay, copy/export, and old UI paths inconsistent with the timeline.

#### Correct

```rust
let segments = normalize_assistant_segments(&content, reasoning.as_deref(), &tool_calls, segments);
let stored_content = content_from_segments(&segments).unwrap_or_else(|| content.clone());
let stored_reasoning = reasoning_from_segments(&segments).or(reasoning);
```

```typescript
const segment = streamPayloadToSegment(payload)
if (segment) {
  snapshot.segments = upsertStreamSegment(snapshot.segments, segment, delta)
}
```

Backend-owned segments define the timeline; legacy fields are deterministic projections of that same timeline.

## Scenario: Generated Artifact Delivery Cards

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes that alter `ChatToolArtifact`, sandbox artifact export, `run_python` artifact handling, generated-file prompt/tool descriptions, generated file opening commands, or Chat UI rendering of tool artifacts.
- Generated files are model/tool outputs, not user attachments. They travel through tool records and assistant message `artifacts`, then render as assistant-side file delivery cards.

### 2. Signatures

- `ChatToolArtifact { name, mime_type, data_url, size_bytes?, path? }`
- TypeScript compatibility aliases: `mimeType`, `dataUrl`, `sizeBytes`, plus optional `path` / `filePath` / `localPath` for frontend tolerance.
- `export_sandbox_artifacts(ctx, artifacts) -> Vec<SandboxExportedArtifact { artifact_index, path }>`
- `chat_open_generated_artifact(path: String) -> Result<(), String>`
- Model-facing prompt surfaces:
  - `chat/agent/prepare.rs::native_tools_prompt(...)`
  - `mcp/types.rs::native_run_python_tool()`

### 3. Contracts

- Python/Pyodide outputs continue to return inline `data_url` artifacts for persistence and preview.
- Backend export writes supported artifacts under `~/Kivio/runs/{conversation}/{message}/`, then uses `artifact_index` to copy the exported absolute path back onto the same persisted artifact.
- Frontend image artifacts stay on the image preview path. Non-image artifacts render as file cards with type, filename, preview, and open action.
- File-card previews may decode text-like `data_url` content. Binary/table artifacts should show metadata rather than parsing in the UI.
- Generated artifact paths are local cache paths with retention semantics; durable user-requested files still require explicit file tools such as `write_file`.
- `run_python` is the default model-facing tool for transient chat deliverables when it is enabled. If the user naturally asks to generate, export, send, package, or provide a report, summary, table, dataset, chart, Markdown, CSV, JSON, TXT, HTML, or XLSX file, prompts/tool descriptions must instruct the model to create a relative Pyodide output artifact without requiring the user to mention Python or `run_python`.
- If the user gives an explicit durable host path such as `~/Desktop/report.md` or asks to save into a local project path, the model should use file tools such as `write_file` instead of relying on the sandbox artifact cache.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Artifact lacks `path` but has `data_url` | Frontend may open an inline data/preview fallback. |
| Artifact has `path` outside `~/Kivio/runs` | `chat_open_generated_artifact` rejects it. |
| Artifact path is relative, empty, missing, or not a file | `chat_open_generated_artifact` returns an error and does not call shell open. |
| Export fails | Tool content includes an export warning; inline artifacts remain persisted for preview. |
| Existing conversation lacks `path` | Deserializes and renders from old artifact fields. |
| `run_python` is not enabled | Do not inject generated-file instructions that claim sandbox artifact generation is available. |
| User asks for inline code / no file | Answer inline; do not call `run_python` merely to generate code text. |
| User asks for a durable host path | Use `write_file` or another explicit file tool, not the transient sandbox artifact cache. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `run_python` creates `report.md`; backend exports it, persists `artifact.path`, and Chat renders a Markdown file card that opens the exported file.
- Good: user says "整理成报告发我" and `run_python` is enabled; the model calls `run_python`, writes `report.md`, and final text only briefly says the file was generated.
- Good: `run_python` creates `chart.png`; Chat keeps rendering it as an image preview, not as a file card.
- Base: old artifacts with only `dataUrl` still show a card/preview where possible.
- Bad: frontend opens arbitrary absolute paths from persisted JSON without backend validation.
- Bad: long assistant text is automatically saved as a file without an explicit tool/output artifact.
- Bad: assistant tells the user to ask for Python or type `run_python` before it can generate a report file.

### 6. Tests Required

- Rust: sandbox export returns `artifact_index` + path and writes under the runs tree.
- Rust: generated artifact path resolver rejects files outside `~/Kivio/runs`.
- Rust: prompt/tool definition tests assert that `run_python` is described as the proactive generated-artifact tool and that users need not mention Python/`run_python`.
- Frontend: non-image artifacts render as file cards.
- Frontend: image artifacts do not render as file cards.
- Project checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, relevant Vitest tests, and Rust tests for sandbox export/open validation.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```typescript
window.open(artifact.path)
```

This trusts persisted local paths in the webview and can open files outside Kivio's generated-artifact cache.

#### Correct

```typescript
await invoke('chat_open_generated_artifact', { path: artifact.path })
```

The backend canonicalizes the path and allows only files under `~/Kivio/runs`.

## Scenario: Agent Todo Runtime State

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes that add or modify agent-owned conversation state maintained by model tools, especially `agent_todo_state`, `todo_write`, `todo_update`, prompt injection, or `chat-todo` events.
- This is agent runtime state, not a user task manager. Users may observe it in the Chat UI, but they must not manually edit it.

### 2. Signatures

- Persistent model: `Conversation.agent_todo_state: AgentTodoState` with `#[serde(default)]` for old conversation JSON. **Task state is per-conversation (isolated)** — it is never shared across conversations, including conversations in the same project.
- State shape: `AgentTodoState { items: Vec<AgentTodoItem>, updated_at: i64 }`.
- Item shape: `AgentTodoItem { id, content, description?, status, blocks: Vec<String>, blocked_by: Vec<String>, owner? }` — `content` is the one-line subject (name kept for back-compat); `description`/`owner`/edges are optional, all serde-default. `owner` marks who a todo is delegated to in the orchestrator-worker model: it is set top-down BY THE PARENT (e.g. `owner = sub-agent name`) when delegating work; it is NOT a flag a sub-agent claims for itself (sub-agents have no todo access).
- Status enum: `pending | in_progress | completed | cancelled`. `cancelled` does not participate in the single-`in_progress` invariant.
- Native tools: `todo_write({ todos })` replaces the full list; `todo_update({ id, content?, description?, status?, blocks?, blocked_by?, owner?, delete? })` updates or (with `delete: true`) removes one item.
- Tauri event: `chat-todo` payload `{ conversationId, todoState }`.

### 3. Contracts

- Canonical todo state lives on `Conversation`, not only in tool records or message metadata. It is conversation-scoped: switching conversations shows that conversation's own list (an unrelated conversation must not inherit another's tasks).
- **Dependency edges**: `normalized_state` auto-syncs reverse edges (`A.blocks ∋ B ⇔ B.blocked_by ∋ A`), drops self/invalid/duplicate edges, and cleans edges pointing at deleted items. Edges are data-model only this phase — they do NOT block marking a `blocked_by` item `in_progress` (execution constraints are deferred). `owner` is consumed in P3 as a top-down delegation marker set by the parent orchestrator (= sub-agent name); sub-agents never read or write todos themselves.
- Tool results carry `structured_content { todoState, changed }`; `changed` is a field-level receipt of what this call modified.
- Current todo state must be injected into the model system/runtime prompt before `build_chat_api_messages`, and `compute_context_state` must include the same prompt segment for token estimates.
- Todo tools are appended by the Chat runtime when the provider supports tool calls; they are not governed by user MCP/native-tool settings, assistant tool presets, or data connector filters.
- Todo tools are serial state writes. They bypass approval but must not be added to the native parallel-safe set.
- Task state remains agent-owned and user-read-only this phase (a user edit entry point is deferred to P4).
- The frontend treats todo state as read-only conversation data and updates it from `chat-todo`.
- If a tool writes conversation state during `run_agent_loop`, `complete_assistant_reply` must reload/merge the latest todo state before saving the assistant message, otherwise the older in-memory `Conversation` can overwrite the tool update.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Old conversation lacks `agent_todo_state` | Deserialize to an empty default state. |
| `todo_write.todos` contains empty `id` or `content` | Return a tool error; do not save state. |
| `todo_write.todos` contains duplicate ids | Return a tool error; do not save state. |
| More than one item is `in_progress` | Normalize to at most one `in_progress`; demote extras to `pending`. |
| `todo_update.id` is missing or unknown | Return a tool error; do not save state. |
| `todo_update` provides neither `content` nor `status` | Return a tool error; do not save state. |
| Provider does not support tools or is Apple local | Inject todo context as read-only; do not expose todo tools. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: model calls `todo_write` at the start of a multi-step task, then `todo_update` as work advances; UI receives `chat-todo` and later turns see the persisted state in context.
- Base: conversation has no todos; prompt says there are no current todos and UI renders no panel.
- Bad: storing todo only in `ToolCallRecord.structured_content`; next turn loses the working state after reload or compaction.
- Bad: appending todo tools before assistant/data-connector filters; `tool_preset: none` can accidentally remove agent housekeeping.
- Bad: saving the old in-memory conversation after tool execution without merging latest `agent_todo_state`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Serde compatibility: old conversation JSON without `agent_todo_state` loads with an empty state.
- Normalization: multiple `in_progress` items collapse to one.
- Update behavior: setting a new item to `in_progress` demotes the previous active item.
- Prompt/context: todo prompt segment appears in both request construction and context estimates.
- Tool trace: successful todo tools persist `structured_content.todoState`.
- Frontend type/build: `npm run typecheck` verifies `chat-todo` payload and read-only panel wiring.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let result = run_agent_loop(...).await?;
push_assistant_message(app, state, settings, conversation, ..., result.tool_records, ...).await?;
```

This can overwrite todo changes that a tool already saved to disk during the run.

#### Correct

```rust
let result = run_agent_loop(...).await?;
merge_latest_agent_todo_state(app, conversation);
push_assistant_message(app, state, settings, conversation, ..., result.tool_records, ...).await?;
```

Tool-owned conversation state must be merged back before the final conversation save.

## Scenario: Agent Plan / Orchestrate Mode Runtime State

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes that add or modify Act / Plan / Orchestrate behavior, especially `agent_plan_state`, plan/orchestrate prompt injection, plan approval commands, Plan-mode tool filtering, sub-agent tool exposure gating, or `chat-plan` events.
- This is a single three-state agent runtime mode (named `AgentPlanMode` for back-compat; do NOT rename to `AgentMode`). The three modes:
  - **Act** (default): normal execution; all enabled tools available, including passive sub-agent spawn tools.
  - **Plan**: investigate + draft an implementation plan before side-effecting actions are allowed; side-effecting tools (including sub-agent spawn) are filtered out.
  - **Orchestrate**: proactively delegate decomposable/parallel work to sub-agents (plan with `todo_write`, delegate via `owner` + `agent`, aggregate); raised autonomy budget.
- The persisted plan is read-only from the user's perspective. Do not add user-editable plan fields without a product decision.

### 2. Signatures

- Persistent model: `Conversation.agent_plan_state: AgentPlanState` with `#[serde(default)]` for old conversation JSON.
- State shape: `AgentPlanState { mode: AgentPlanMode, status: AgentPlanStatus, plan: Option<String>, updated_at: i64 }`.
- Mode enum: `act | plan | orchestrate` (serde `snake_case`; default `act`). Frontend TS `AgentPlanMode = 'act' | 'plan' | 'orchestrate'`.
- Helpers in `chat/plan.rs`: `mode_from_str` accepts `"act"|"plan"|"orchestrate"`; `is_plan_mode`; `is_orchestrate_mode`; `with_mode`; `format_prompt` (mode-aware).
- Budget constant: `settings::ORCHESTRATE_MIN_TOOL_ROUNDS = 40`.
- Status enum: `empty | draft | approved`.
- Tauri commands:
  - `chat_set_agent_plan_mode(conversation_id: String, mode: String) -> { success, conversation, planState }`
  - `chat_execute_agent_plan(conversation_id: String) -> { success, conversation, planState }`
- Tauri event: `chat-plan` payload `{ conversationId, planState }`.
- Prompt segment id: `agent_plan` (same id carries plan OR orchestrate text depending on mode).

### 3. Contracts

- New conversations start in `mode = act`, `status = empty`, `plan = None`.
- `chat_set_agent_plan_mode` accepts `act`, `plan`, or `orchestrate` (via `mode_from_str`); it preserves the saved plan text and status while changing mode.
- `chat_execute_agent_plan` switches to `act`; if a non-empty plan exists, status becomes `approved`, otherwise it remains `empty`.
- In Plan mode, the final assistant reply is captured as a draft plan only when the original turn started in Plan mode and the latest saved state is still Plan mode. Orchestrate mode does NOT capture draft plans (it executes).
- `format_prompt` emits a mode-specific `agent_plan` segment: Plan = plan-then-stop guidance; Orchestrate = imperative proactive-delegation guidance — the orchestrator's default is to fan out, and it MUST dispatch one sub-agent per part whenever a task splits into 2+ independent/parallelizable/separable parts (research/compare/multi-source/multi-file work named as must-fan-out scenarios), keeping only a genuinely indivisible single-step small task for itself (plan via `todo_write`, delegate by setting todo `owner` + `agent` spawn, mark `completed`, aggregate); Act = saved-plan-as-context.
- Current plan/orchestrate prompt must be injected into the system/runtime prompt before `build_chat_api_messages`, and `compute_context_state` must include the same `agent_plan` segment for token estimates. Because both paths call `format_prompt`, making `format_prompt` mode-aware keeps the request and the token estimate aligned automatically.
- **Sub-agent tool exposure is mode-controlled, NOT a settings toggle.** Act and Orchestrate both expose `agent` / `check_agent_result` / `list_agent_tasks` (passive vs. proactive); Plan does not. The gate is `provider.supports_tools && !plan_mode` (the removed `chat_tools.sub_agents` flag no longer participates).
- **Orchestrate raises the autonomy budget**: `effective_chat_tools.max_tool_rounds` becomes `Some(n.max(ORCHESTRATE_MIN_TOOL_ROUNDS))`. `None` (unlimited) stays `None` — orchestrate never forces a cap onto an unlimited config.
- In Act mode, approved or draft plan text remains contextual; if the user asks to execute/continue, the model should use it unless the latest user message changes requirements.
- Plan mode must filter side-effecting tools before model invocation. Allowed tools are:
  - native read-only tools: `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `read_file`, `memory_read`, `memory_search`
  - MCP tools with explicit `readOnlyHint == true` and no destructive/open-world hints
  - skill discovery/read tools: `skill_activate`, `skill_read_file`
  - agent todo tools: `todo_write`, `todo_update`
- Plan mode must not expose writes/edits, command execution, `run_python`, memory mutation, Mixer image generation, `skill_run_script`, sub-agent spawn (`agent`), or arbitrary/non-read-only MCP tools. (Orchestrate mode does NOT apply this filter.)
- Tools removed by the Plan filter must be kept as blocked metadata for the current run. If the model still requests one through fallback markup or stale provider state, emit a visible `ToolCallRecord` with `status = skipped` and return model-facing feedback that the tool is blocked in Plan mode.
- If plan state is updated while a reply is being completed, `complete_assistant_reply` must reload/merge the latest plan state before saving the assistant message, otherwise an older in-memory `Conversation` can overwrite the plan update.
- The frontend treats plan state as read-only conversation data and updates it from `chat-plan`. The InputBar surfaces mode entry via `/plan` and `/orchestrate` slash commands and a Shift+Tab cycle (act → plan → orchestrate → act).

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Old conversation lacks `agent_plan_state` | Deserialize to default Act/Empty state. |
| `chat_set_agent_plan_mode` receives an unknown mode | Return an error; do not save conversation state. |
| Plan mode assistant reply is blank | Do not replace the current plan. |
| User executes with no saved plan | Switch to Act and keep status `empty`. |
| User executes with a saved plan | Switch to Act and mark status `approved`. |
| Plan mode tool list includes write/command/Python/memory mutation/image/script tools | Remove them before provider invocation. |
| Model requests a tool removed by Plan filtering | Emit a visible skipped tool record and return a tool message explaining it is blocked in Plan mode. |
| Non-read-only MCP tool has `readOnlyHint == false`, missing read-only metadata, `destructiveHint == true`, or `openWorldHint == true` | Remove it in Plan mode. |
| `chat_set_agent_plan_mode` receives `orchestrate` | Switch mode to Orchestrate, preserve plan text/status. |
| Mode is Orchestrate | Expose sub-agent spawn tools, inject orchestrate prompt, raise `max_tool_rounds` to `max(configured, 40)`; do NOT apply the Plan side-effecting filter. |
| Mode is Orchestrate with `max_tool_rounds == None` | Keep `None` (unlimited); do not impose a 40 cap. |
| Provider does not support tools or is Apple local | Inject plan/orchestrate context as prompt text; do not expose unavailable tools. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: user switches to Plan, asks for implementation analysis, the agent reads files/searches web, returns a plan, and the draft is visible and persisted on the conversation.
- Good: user clicks Execute Plan, runtime switches to Act, sends a continuation request, and the saved plan is injected into the next model turn.
- Good: user switches to Orchestrate and asks for a multi-part task; the model plans with `todo_write`, sets each independent todo's `owner` to a sub-agent name and `in_progress`, fans out `agent` spawns, marks todos `completed`, then aggregates — within the raised round budget.
- Base: no plan exists; UI shows no plan panel, prompt says there is no saved plan, and Act behavior is unchanged.
- Base: Act mode still exposes sub-agent spawn tools (passive), but the model only uses them when the task warrants it.
- Bad: Plan mode only changes the system prompt while leaving `write_file`, `run_command`, `run_python`, or `agent` in the tool schema.
- Bad: gating sub-agent exposure on a settings flag instead of mode (the `chat_tools.sub_agents` toggle was removed).
- Bad: storing the plan only in assistant message text; next turn loses the accepted plan after reload, compaction, or route changes.
- Bad: treating the plan as a calendar/reminder/task-management object or allowing manual user edits in the MVP.

### 6. Tests Required

- Serde compatibility: old conversation JSON without `agent_plan_state` loads as Act/Empty.
- State helpers: draft capture trims non-empty assistant replies and approval marks saved plans as `approved`.
- Mode helpers: `mode_from_str("orchestrate")` parses, `is_orchestrate_mode` detects, and `format_prompt` emits an orchestrate-specific segment (zh + en).
- Orchestrate budget: `max_tool_rounds` bump raises below-floor configured rounds, preserves above-floor, and keeps `None` unlimited.
- Prompt/context: `agent_plan` prompt segment (plan OR orchestrate text) appears in both request construction and context estimates.
- Tool filter: Plan mode keeps read-only native/MCP, skill read tools, and todo tools while removing writes, commands, Python, memory mutation, image generation, script execution, sub-agent spawn, and non-read-only MCP tools.
- Blocked-tool trace: a model request for a Plan-filtered tool yields a `skipped` record rather than silently disappearing.
- Command registration/API: new Tauri commands are registered and frontend types mirror the payload.
- Frontend type/build: `npm run typecheck` verifies `chat-plan` event wiring, Act/Plan/Orchestrate controls (slash + Shift+Tab cycle), Execute Plan flow, and read-only plan panel props.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let system_prompt = format!("{base}\nPlan mode: don't edit files");
let tools = list_tools_for_chat(...).await;
```

This asks the model not to act while still exposing side-effecting tools.

```rust
let result = run_agent_loop(...).await?;
capture_plan_from_reply(conversation, &result.content);
push_assistant_message(..., conversation, ...).await?;
```

This can overwrite a concurrently saved plan/mode change with stale in-memory conversation state.

#### Correct

```rust
apply_agent_plan_tool_filter(&mut tools, is_plan_mode);
let agent_plan_prompt = plan::format_prompt(&conversation.agent_plan_state, &language);
```

```rust
let result = run_agent_loop(...).await?;
merge_latest_agent_plan_state(app, conversation);
capture_agent_plan_draft_if_needed(app, conversation, is_plan_mode, &result.content);
push_assistant_message(..., conversation, ...).await?;
```

Plan mode must be enforced by both prompt context and backend tool availability, and persisted state must be merged before the final save.

## Scenario: Project Workspace Filesystem

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes that connect Chat projects to local folders, alter `Conversation.project_id`, `ChatProject.root_path`, native filesystem tools, command cwd behavior, or model-facing tool descriptions.
- Project workspace support is a workspace permission system, not an OS sandbox. Native filesystem tools are project-scoped in project conversations; `run_command` is a sensitive host-shell capability that starts from the project root by default and is governed by approval/user-intent semantics rather than a chroot-like guarantee.

### 2. Signatures

- Persistent project model: `ChatProject { id, name, description?, color?, root_path?, created_at, updated_at }`.
- Persistent conversation model: `Conversation.project_id: Option<String>` with `folder: Option<String>` retained for legacy display/fallback.
- Tauri commands:
  - `chat_get_conversations(offset, limit, folder?, project_id?) -> { success, conversations }`
  - `chat_create_conversation(provider_id?, model?, folder?, project_id?, assistant_id?) -> { success, conversation }`
  - `chat_create_project(name, description?, color?, root_path?) -> { success, project }`
  - `chat_update_project(project_id, name?, description?, color?, root_path?) -> { success, project }`
  - `chat_update_conversation(conversation_id, ..., folder?, project_id?, ...) -> { success, conversation }`
- Workspace resolver: `NativeToolWorkspace::{global(workspace_roots), project(project_id, project_name, root_path)}`.
- Native project filesystem tools:
  - Read/list/search/stat: `read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_files`, `glob_files`, `stat_path`
  - Mutations: `write_file`, `edit_file`, `create_dir`, `delete_path`, `move_path`, `copy_path`
  - Commands: `run_command`
  - Python file inputs: `run_python.files`

### 3. Contracts

- Project membership uses `Conversation.project_id` as the durable link. `folder` is compatibility/display data and may be used only as a fallback for legacy conversations without `project_id`.
- Project roots are normalized to canonical absolute directories before storage. Empty `root_path` means the project is chat-only until the user binds a folder. Project update commands must distinguish an omitted nullable field from an explicit `null`; explicit `null` clears `description`, `color`, or `root_path`, while omitted fields preserve the current value.
- Tool execution resolves `conversation_id -> Conversation -> ChatProject -> root_path` at native tool call time.
- In project mode, native file-tool relative paths resolve under the project root. Absolute paths for native file tools are accepted only if their canonical target stays inside the same root.
- Missing write targets are checked by canonicalizing the nearest existing parent, then joining missing path components. This prevents parent symlink escapes.
- Paths containing `..` are rejected before filesystem access.
- In project mode, `run_command` defaults its startup `cwd` to the project root. Explicit `cwd` is validated as a workspace-local startup directory and must be an existing directory. The shell command itself remains a host-shell command; do not describe it as sharing the exact native file-tool boundary.
- `run_command` must remain sensitive/approval-gated under the default policy. Model-facing instructions must say to honor explicit user constraints such as “do not use shell” or “do not access project-outside paths”, and to explain or ask before cross-directory, destructive, network, or environment-changing shell commands.
- In project mode without a bound `root_path`, filesystem tools and command tools return a clear bind-folder-first error.
- Outside project mode, existing global native-tool behavior remains the fallback: read paths use readable local path resolution, write paths use `workspaceRoots`/home constraints, and command cwd falls back to first workspace root or home.
- Model-facing prompt/tool descriptions must distinguish native file tools from host shell behavior: project file paths are project-relative by default and backend validation enforces the native file-tool boundary; shell is a sensitive host capability with default project cwd and approval/user-intent controls.
- Read-only project tools may join the native parallel-safe set only when they do not require approval: `read_file`, `list_dir`, `search_files`, `glob_files`, `stat_path`.
- Mutation tools and `run_command` remain approval-sensitive and serial.
- `copy_path` must reject copying a directory to itself or any descendant path before creating the destination, otherwise recursive copy can grow without bound.
- Deleting a symlink inside the project deletes the link entry itself. Boundary checks for delete/move-source operations must not follow the final symlink target; parent directories are still resolved canonically so parent symlinks cannot escape the project.
- `glob_files.pattern` is a pattern relative to the search `path`; absolute or `..`-containing path-like patterns must return a clear argument error instead of a silent empty match set.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Project id is provided when creating/updating a conversation | Resolve by id, set `conversation.project_id`, and mirror project name into `folder`. |
| Only legacy `folder` is provided | Resolve project by name when possible; otherwise preserve folder as legacy grouping. |
| Project root is empty | Store `root_path = None`; project remains chat-only for filesystem operations. |
| Project update omits `root_path` | Preserve the existing project root. |
| Project update explicitly clears `root_path` | Store `root_path = None`; project becomes chat-only for filesystem operations. |
| Project root is relative, missing, or not a directory | Reject project create/update with a user-facing error. |
| Project native file-tool path contains `..` | Reject before touching the filesystem. |
| Project native file-tool absolute path resolves outside root | Reject with a project-root boundary error. |
| Project write target does not exist and parent symlink points outside root | Reject after canonical parent resolution. |
| `copy_path` directory destination equals or is inside source | Reject before creating the destination directory. |
| Project `run_command.cwd` is omitted | Use project root. |
| Project `run_command.cwd` resolves outside root or is not a directory | Reject before spawning the process. This validates only the startup directory, not every path the shell may touch after launch. |
| User explicitly says not to use shell | Do not call `run_command`; if shell is required for verification, ask first. |
| Project-internal symlink points outside root and `delete_path` targets the symlink | Delete the link entry without deleting or reading the outside target. |
| `glob_files.pattern` is absolute or contains `..` | Return an argument error explaining that `pattern` is relative and `path` selects the search root. |
| Legacy/no-root project uses file or command tool | Return an error telling the user to bind a local folder first. |
| Non-project conversation uses tools | Preserve global workspace-root fallback behavior. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: user selects a sidebar project bound to `/repo/app`, asks to inspect `src/App.tsx`, and the model calls `read_file({ path: "src/App.tsx" })`.
- Good: user asks to run tests in a project conversation; `run_command({ command: "npm test" })` runs from the project root without needing an explicit cwd.
- Good: user asks for a repo-wide shell command that touches a sibling repo; the agent explains that shell is a host capability and asks for confirmation instead of claiming the project is a hard sandbox.
- Base: old name-only projects continue showing conversations, but file tools explain that a folder must be bound first.
- Bad: tool execution relies on the project name alone after rename; use `project_id` instead.
- Bad: prompt says paths should stay in the project, but backend still accepts `/Users/...` outside root.
- Bad: prompt implies `run_command` is sandboxed the same way as `read_file`, causing misleading safety claims.
- Bad: user says “do not run shell”, but the model calls `run_command` for convenience.

### 6. Tests Required

- Storage compatibility: old conversations without `project_id` still list under the matching project name.
- Conversation create/update: project id sets both `project_id` and legacy `folder`.
- Project create/update: root path is canonicalized and invalid roots are rejected.
- Project update: explicit `null` clears `root_path`, while omitted `root_path` leaves it unchanged.
- Native path resolver: rejects `..`, absolute outside-root paths, and symlink parent escapes for missing write targets.
- Native tools: read/list/search/stat succeed on project-relative paths; write/edit/delete/move/copy cannot escape root.
- Native tools: `delete_path` removes a project-internal symlink whose target is outside root, without touching the target.
- Native tools: `glob_files` rejects absolute or `..` path-like patterns with an explicit error.
- Native tools: `copy_path` rejects directory copies into itself or descendants.
- Command cwd: omitted cwd uses root; outside-root explicit cwd is rejected as a startup directory.
- Prompt/tool definitions: new tool names appear in schemas, disabled-tool feedback, project-relative file-tool wording, and non-sandbox shell wording.
- Frontend type/build: `npm run typecheck` verifies project id/root path propagation.
- Backend checks: targeted `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml native_tools mcp::types chat::agent::prepare -- --nocapture` or equivalent split filters, plus full `cargo test` when practical.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let full = resolve_workspace_path(path, workspace_roots)?;
```

This ignores the active conversation project and keeps writes scoped to global settings instead of the selected workspace.

```rust
let cwd = arguments.get("cwd").unwrap_or("~/");
```

This ignores the project default startup directory and approval semantics.

#### Correct

```rust
let workspace = resolve_native_workspace(app, workspace_roots, native_ctx.as_ref())?;
let full = resolve_tool_write_path(&workspace, path)?;
```

```rust
let cwd = resolve_tool_existing_dir(&workspace, arguments.get("cwd").and_then(|v| v.as_str()))?;
```

Resolve the current project at tool-call time, use shared project-aware resolvers for native file paths and command startup cwd, and describe shell as a sensitive host capability rather than a project sandbox.

## Scenario: Agent File Mutation Tools

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes to native file mutation tools, tool-call result records, MCP structured content handling, agent file-editing prompts, or Chat UI rendering of file changes.
- Agent coding edits should prefer targeted mutations with visible diff metadata. Whole-file writes remain available for new files, explicit full replacement, or requested deliverable files.

### 2. Signatures

- Native tools:
  - `write_file({ path, content }) -> FileMutationResult`
  - `write_file_chunk({ path, mode: start|append|finish, content? }) -> FileMutationResult`
  - `edit_file({ path, old_string, new_string, replace_all? }) -> FileMutationResult`
  - `patch({ patch }) -> FileMutationResult`
- Patch grammar:

```text
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: path/to/new.ts
+content
*** Update File: path/to/existing.ts
@@
 context
-old
+new
*** Delete File: path/to/old.ts
*** End Patch
```

- Structured result:

```rust
FileMutationResult {
    operation,
    resolved_path?,
    files: Vec<FileMutationFile>,
    bytes_written,
    additions,
    removals,
    diff,
    warnings,
    diagnostics,
}
```

- Per-file result:

```rust
FileMutationFile {
    path,
    operation,
    bytes_written,
    additions,
    removals,
    diff,
}
```

### 3. Contracts

- `write_file`, `write_file_chunk`, `edit_file`, and `patch` must return `McpToolCallResult.structured_content = FileMutationResult` and a concise text `content` summary for model replay.
- `ToolCallRecord.structured_content` must preserve file mutation metadata across backend events, persisted messages, and frontend rendering. Do not rely on raw JSON previews for file mutation UX.
- Tool content sent back to the model may include `structuredContent` when the text summary does not already contain the same JSON, following the shared MCP structured-content contract.
- `write_file` is for new files, explicit whole-file replacement, or requested deliverables. Existing-file small edits should use `edit_file`; multi-file or larger code edits should use `patch`.
- `write_file_chunk` is for long file content (roughly > 200 lines or > 8 KB) instead of one giant `write_file` argument: `mode=start` creates/overwrites the file with the first portion, `mode=append` requires an existing file and appends the next portion, `mode=finish` verifies the file and returns its final state. Every call persists immediately, so an interrupted generation keeps all prior chunks on disk.
- `write_file_chunk` is serial, sensitive, and approval-gated like `write_file`: never in the native parallel-safe set, blocked in Plan mode, and it acquires the per-resolved-path in-process lock on every call.
- Inline code/demo requests that do not ask to save locally must hide `write_file`, `write_file_chunk`, and `patch` from the model. `edit_file` may remain available because project-edit requests still need targeted existing-file edits.
- `patch` file headers must be project-relative: no absolute path, `~`, backslashes, roots, or `..`.
- A completely empty line inside an Update File hunk is tolerated as an empty context line (equivalent to `" "`), matching `git apply` behavior, not a parse error.
- In project mode, all file mutations must use project-aware resolvers and stay inside the bound project root. Outside project mode, they must preserve global workspace/home write constraints.
- File mutation tools must be serial, approval-sensitive tools. They must not join the native parallel-safe read-only batch.
- File mutation tools must acquire per-resolved-path in-process locks before reading current contents and before applying writes/deletes. `delete_path`, `move_path` (source + destination), and `copy_path` (destination) acquire the same per-path mutation locks. Multi-file `patch` locks all resolved targets in sorted order to avoid deadlocks.
- `move_path` resolves its source without following the final symlink (same entry semantics as `delete_path`): moving a project-internal symlink moves the link entry, not its target.
- `patch` must fully validate and build all planned file results before applying any filesystem changes. A failed hunk, missing target, duplicate target, traversal path, or existing Add File target must leave every involved file unchanged.
- `edit_file` requires exactly one `old_string` match unless `replace_all` is true.
- Diff metadata may use lightweight unified diffs, but additions/removals must match the per-file changed lines shown in the diff.
- Frontend file mutation blocks should show operation, target path or file count, `+/-` stats, warnings/diagnostics, and an expandable diff.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| `write_file.path` missing or content missing | Return a tool argument error before writing. |
| `write_file_chunk` mode=append or mode=finish targets a missing file | Return a tool error telling the model to call `mode=start` first; do not write. |
| `write_file_chunk.mode` is not `start`/`append`/`finish` | Return a tool argument error before touching the filesystem. |
| `write_file` overwrite or `write_file_chunk` mode=start hits an existing non-UTF-8 file | Succeed; report `overwrite` with diff omitted plus a warning explaining why. |
| `edit_file.old_string` is missing in the file | Return an error and do not write. |
| `edit_file.old_string` appears multiple times and `replace_all` is false | Return an error telling the model to use a unique old string or `replace_all=true`. |
| `edit_file.old_string == new_string` | Return a structured noop result with a warning and do not rewrite content. |
| `patch` does not start/end with the required markers | Return a parse error and do not write. |
| `patch` path is absolute, uses `~`, contains backslashes, roots, or `..` | Reject before resolving/writing. |
| `patch` Add File target already exists | Return an error and do not write any file. |
| `patch` Update/Delete target is not an existing file | Return an error and do not write any file. |
| `patch` hunk content is not an exact unique match | Return an error and do not write any file. |
| Two patch headers refer to the same textual or resolved file path | Return an error before applying. |
| Concurrent runs mutate the same resolved path | Later mutation waits on the in-process path lock before reading/applying. |
| Final provider synthesis fails after a successful mutation | Keep the completed tool record and surface provider failure separately. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: user asks to change one label in `src/App.tsx`; the model reads the file and calls `edit_file` with a unique old/new replacement.
- Good: user asks for coordinated frontend/backend edits; the model emits a single `patch` that updates several files and the UI shows affected files plus diff stats.
- Good: a provider fails after `patch` succeeds; the chat timeline still shows the patch block as completed with its files and diff metadata.
- Good: the model writes a 1000-line file in 4 `write_file_chunk` calls (start + 3 appends); the stream dies after chunk 2, chunks 1-2 are already on disk, and the next turn appends the rest instead of regenerating everything.
- Base: user asks to create a new `index.html`; the model calls `write_file` and receives a structured create result.
- Bad: regenerating an entire existing source file through `write_file` for a two-line change.
- Bad: applying the first file in a multi-file patch before verifying later hunks; failures would leave a half-applied repo.
- Bad: storing file mutation details only in model-facing text; the frontend cannot reliably render paths, stats, or diff.
- Bad: a scheduler parallelizes `write_file_chunk` calls or reorders an append before its start; chunk order is the file content, so the calls must run serially in model order.

### 6. Tests Required

- Native tools: `write_file` returns structured diff stats for create/overwrite.
- Native tools: `write_file_chunk` start/append/finish persists each chunk immediately, append/finish on a missing file error with mode=start guidance, and the tool stays serial and blocked in Plan mode.
- Native tools: `edit_file` enforces uniqueness and returns a structured noop warning when old/new match.
- Patch parser/apply: add, update, and delete files in one patch.
- Patch parser: an empty line inside an Update File hunk applies as an empty context line.
- Patch safety: failed hunk does not partially modify earlier planned files.
- Patch safety: traversal/absolute/backslash/tilde paths are rejected.
- Patch safety: duplicate textual or resolved paths are rejected.
- Runtime: `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `patch` preserve `structured_content` on `ToolCallRecord` and model replay content.
- Prompt/filter: inline code-block requests remove `write_file`, `write_file_chunk`, and `patch`, while save/edit intents keep them.
- Frontend type/build: `npm run typecheck` verifies file mutation structured content parsing and `ToolCallBlock` rendering.
- Backend checks: run targeted native/MCP/agent prompt tests plus full `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` when practical.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```rust
let after = apply_first_hunk_and_write(path)?;
let second = apply_second_file()?; // can fail after the first file changed
```

This leaves the project half-mutated when a later file fails.

```tsx
const preview = toolCall.resultPreview || JSON.stringify(toolCall.raw)
```

This treats file changes as opaque text and loses reliable diff/status rendering.

#### Correct

```rust
let plans = build_all_patch_plans(&ops)?;
let _guard = acquire_file_mutation_locks(plans.iter().map(|p| p.path.clone()))?;
let file_results = build_file_results(&plans)?;
apply_plans(plans)?;
```

```tsx
const mutation = structuredFileMutation(toolCall)
return mutation ? <FileMutationDetails mutation={mutation} /> : <GenericToolDetails />
```

Build and validate all mutation plans first, lock resolved target paths before reading/applying, persist structured metadata, and render file changes from that structured contract.

## Scenario: Multi-Agent / Sub-Agent Runtime

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changes to `chat/sub_agent.rs`, `agents/**`, `chat/agent/filter.rs`, the `NativeToolCall::SubAgent` dispatch, or the `depth` / `tool_conversation_id` threading through `AgentRunConfig` → `ToolRoundContext` → `ToolExecutionContext` → `NativeToolContext`.
- A sub-agent is NOT a second engine: it is a fresh isolated message history (`system + user` only) run through the same `run_agent_loop`, wrapped in a `SubAgentHost`. Landed in P3 (clawspring-refactor roadmap).

### 2. Signatures

- `chat::sub_agent::{agent_tool, check_agent_result_tool, list_agent_tasks_tool}` — the three native tool defs, registered in `NATIVE_TOOLS` with `enabled=false` (appended in `complete_assistant_reply` via `append_tool_definitions(&mut tools, allow_spawn)`). Exposure is mode-controlled: appended only when `supports_tools && !plan_mode` (i.e. in Act + Orchestrate, not Plan). The legacy `chat_tools.sub_agents` settings toggle was removed.
- `NativeToolCall::SubAgent(for<'a> fn(SubAgentCallCtx<'a>) -> NativeToolFuture<'a>)` — dispatched in `call_native_tool` BEFORE workspace resolution (like `Conversation`), carrying `NativeToolContext { conversation_id (=parent), run_id, generation, depth, tool_call_id }`.
- `run_sub_agent(app, state, SubAgentRequest) -> Result<AgentRunResult, String>` — builds the isolated config and reuses `run_agent_loop`.
- `SubAgentManager` on `AppState.sub_agents`: `tasks` map + `by_name` + `Semaphore(3)`.
- `agents::{load_agent_definitions(app, project_root), find_definition}`; built-ins: `general-purpose` (empty/unrestricted), `researcher`/`reviewer` (read-only sets), `coder`. 3-layer load: built-in → `<app_data>/agents/*.md` → `<project>/.kivio/agents/*.md`.
- `chat::agent::filter::filter_tools_for_agent(&mut tools, &AgentDefinition) -> Vec<removed>`.
- `MAX_SUB_AGENT_DEPTH = 3`; `depth_allows_spawn(depth) = depth < MAX_SUB_AGENT_DEPTH`.

### 3. Contracts

- **Conversation decoupling.** A sub-agent run uses a synthetic `conversation_id = "subagent-{task_id}"` for generation/streaming isolation, but `tool_conversation_id = parent conversation id` so its `todo_update` claims the PARENT's todos and its native file tools resolve the PARENT's project workspace. For a top-level run the two are equal — zero behavior change (`RegistryToolExecutor` builds `NativeToolContext.conversation_id` from `ctx.tool_conversation_id`).
- **Provider/model inheritance.** The spawn handler loads the parent conversation to inherit `provider_id` + `model`; `AgentDefinition.model` overrides the model when set.
- **Depth guard (acceptance #2).** The `agent` handler soft-fails (returns `is_error` result, never `Err`) when `!depth_allows_spawn(ctx.native_ctx.depth)`. Children run at `depth + 1`.
- **No recursion (acceptance #4).** Children never receive the `agent` tool: it is `enabled=false` in the registry (never in `list_enabled_tool_defs`), and `filter_tools_for_agent` strips any `native:agent` as a second guard.
- **Cascade cancel (acceptance #3).** `SubAgentHost::is_generation_active` = `generation_cascade_active(state, sub_conv, sub_gen, parent_conv, parent_gen)` — active only while BOTH the sub generation and the parent generation are live. `run_sub_agent` retires its own generation (`cancel_chat_generation(sub_conv)`) on EVERY exit path (success/failure/timeout) so a dead run never reads active and entries don't pile up "active".
- **Sensitive tools denied at depth > 0.** `SubAgentHost::request_tool_approval` returns `false` unconditionally (a sub-agent cannot escalate to the user); approval-bypass/read-only tools still run. `request_user_response` resolves as a `cancelled` ask_user.
- **Live nested progress (acceptance #1).** `SubAgentHost` forwards down-sampled (`PROGRESS_EMIT_INTERVAL_MS=350`) stream deltas + per-tool step lines as a `chat-subagent` event keyed by `parentToolCallId`; the frontend merges them into the parent tool record's `structured_content.subagentProgress` without clobbering the final `{type:"subagent",...}` result. `Semaphore(3)` caps concurrent sub-agents; `300s` sync timeout.
- **Pure worker, no todo access (acceptance #5).** A sub-agent is a pure worker in the orchestrator-worker model: it is exposed NO todo tools, gets NO todo prompt, and cannot read or mutate any todo list. Task delegation is strictly top-down — the parent conversation uses its OWN todo tools to set a todo's `owner` (= sub-agent name) and mark it `in_progress` before the spawn, then marks it `completed` after the sub-agent returns. Each sub-agent "task" is carried by a global `SubAgentTaskRecord` (id/status/result/usage); the parent creates it on spawn and finishes it on completion. `tool_conversation_id` still points at the parent conversation so the worker's native file tools resolve the parent's project workspace, but with todo tools removed the worker has no way to touch parent todos.
- **Parallel spawn.** The `agent` tool has `parallel_safe = true` in `NATIVE_TOOLS`: a single tool round may dispatch multiple `agent` spawns concurrently (the per-round scheduler caps at `MAX_PARALLEL_TOOL_CALLS_PER_ROUND = 4`; the `SubAgentManager` `Semaphore(3)` is the real ceiling, so a 4th spawn waits for a permit). Each spawn is isolated (own conversation/generation/message history) and bypasses approval, so concurrent runs do not race shared engine state. `check_agent_result`/`list_agent_tasks` stay serial. A sub-agent writes no shared conversation state (no todo access), so parallel spawns have no shared-write contention.
- **Per-agent token usage.** On successful completion the spawn handler reads `AgentRunResult.usage` (the sub-agent's own provider usage, not overlapping the parent conversation) and emits it on the final tool record's `structured_content.usage` as `{ inputTokens, outputTokens, totalTokens }` (each optional/None-omitted), alongside the existing `type/taskId/name/agentType/status/result` fields. `SubAgentTaskRecord.usage` mirrors it for `check_agent_result`/`list_agent_tasks`. Live `subagentProgress` carries no usage; the frontend `SubAgentCard` renders a compact `↑in ↓out · total tokens` line (k-abbreviated) only in the completed state.
- **Mode-controlled exposure.** Sub-agent tools are exposed by agent mode, not a settings flag: Act and Orchestrate expose them (passive vs. proactive), Plan filters them out. The old `chat_tools.sub_agents` opt-in toggle was removed (see the Plan / Orchestrate scenario). Orchestrate additionally injects a proactive-delegation prompt and raises `max_tool_rounds`. Background `wait=false` execution and the `SendMessage` inbox are intentionally deferred (research doc 05 P2 split); v1 spawn is synchronous.

### 4. Tests Required

- `sub_agent`: `depth_guard_rejects_at_max_depth`, `host_cancels_when_parent_generation_cancelled`, `append_tools_strips_spawn_when_not_allowed`/`_includes_spawn_when_allowed`, manager register/lookup/finish.
- `filter`: `always_strips_agent_tool_even_with_empty_allow_list`, `narrows_to_allow_list_and_strips_agent`, `filtering_is_idempotent`.
- `agents`: built-in uniqueness, read-only researcher set, frontmatter + bracket-list parse, file-stem fallback.
- `native_registry`: `EXPECTED_ORDER` includes `agent`/`check_agent_result`/`list_agent_tasks`; bypass-approval and read-only sets updated; sub-agent tools never exposed via `list_native_builtin_tool_defs`.
- Frontend: `npm run typecheck` covers `ChatSubagentPayload`, the merge in `Chat.tsx`, and `SubagentDetails` in `ToolCallBlock.tsx`.
