## Scenario: Chat MVP Cross-Layer Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Chat features span React state, the centralized Tauri bridge, Rust Tauri commands, settings persistence, and JSON file storage.
- Apply this contract whenever changing `src/chat/**`, `src/api/tauri.ts`, or `src-tauri/src/chat/**`.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_get_conversations(offset: usize, limit: usize, folder?: string) -> { success: true, conversations: ConversationListItem[] }`
- `chat_get_conversation(conversationId: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat_create_conversation(providerId?: string, model?: string, folder?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat_send_message(conversationId: string, content: string, attachments: string[]) -> { success: boolean, conversation?: Conversation, error?: string }`
- `chat_update_conversation(conversationId: string, title?: string, pinned?: boolean, folder?: string, providerId?: string, model?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat-stream` event payload is `ChatStreamPayload` in `src/api/tauri.ts`.

### 3. Contracts
- Conversation IDs are backend-owned and must match `conv_*`; frontend must pass IDs returned by chat commands or parsed from `#chat/{conversation_id}`.
- Stored Rust fields use snake_case (`provider_id`, `created_at`); Tauri command argument names from TypeScript use camelCase (`conversationId`, `providerId`).
- `chat_create_conversation` must be idempotent for an existing blank conversation with the same provider, model, folder, and assistant. Backend creation must hold the Chat create lock around reusable-blank lookup plus save; frontend should also reuse the current or remembered blank conversation instead of creating another empty file.
- Chat composer focus belongs on the textarea when the Chat window opens or regains focus. Composer icon buttons may remain mouse-clickable but should not become the default focus target; keep them out of the tab order when they are compact icon-only controls.
- Chat model defaults live in settings as `defaultModels.chat`; legacy `chatProviderId` and `chatModel` are kept as a compatibility mirror. When the structured chat default is unset, backend sanitization falls back to Lens provider/model, then translator provider/model.
- Auxiliary task model slots live under `defaultModels.vision`, `defaultModels.titleSummary`, and `defaultModels.compression`. The Settings UI exposes them on the Mixer tab, not as extra main-chat defaults. Empty slots mean `auto` / use the main chat model behavior.
- `defaultModels.vision` is a pre-processing route, not an answer lane. When explicitly configured and the user sends images, Chat first sends the images to that vision model, converts the result to text, then sends only text to the main chat model for the final answer. When unset, `auto` keeps images on the main chat model only if model metadata does not prove the main model is text-only; if the main model is known `vision=false`, backend auto-selects an enabled `vision=true` model for the pre-processing route.
- New Chat conversation titles are generated after the first assistant reply using `defaultModels.titleSummary` when configured, or the effective Chat default when unset. Title generation is best effort: provider errors, timeouts, missing keys, or invalid title output must fall back to local first-user-message truncation and must not fail `chat_send_message`.
- Model providers expose `enabledModels` and `availableModels`; do not read a `models` array in Chat UI.
- Chat context usage uses model metadata for `context_window_tokens`: provider `modelOverrides[model].contextWindow` wins, then the shared built-in `src/data/modelDatabase.json` match, then backend name heuristics. Explicit metadata must set `context_window_estimated=false`; heuristic fallbacks may remain estimated.
- Streaming payload fields: `{ imageId, kind: 'answer', delta, reasoningDelta?, done?, reason?, full? }`.
- `src/api/tauri.ts` `normalizeSettings` rebuilds nested settings objects. When adding any `Settings.chat` field, preserve it in `normalizeSettings`; otherwise save/load can silently drop the value even if Rust serialization and the Settings UI are correct.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Invalid conversation ID -> backend returns `Err("Invalid conversation id: ...")`; do not construct file paths directly in frontend.
- Missing conversation file -> backend returns a failed invoke; frontend shows a visible load/send error.
- Pagination offset beyond loaded index length -> backend returns an empty list, never panics.
- Repeated `chat_create_conversation` for the same blank Chat scope -> returns the existing blank conversation, not a newly created one.
- Opening Chat with an empty composer -> active focus should be the composer textarea, not the attachment/tool/send icon buttons.
- Stream `reason: 'error'` -> frontend clears streaming state, shows an error, and re-enables input.
- Stream `reason: 'cancelled'` -> frontend clears streaming state without forcing a conversation reload.
- Explicit vision auxiliary model missing provider/key/model or returning empty analysis -> `chat_send_message` fails visibly before the main chat model call instead of asking the main model to guess image content.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `ModelSelector` uses `enabledModels.length > 0 ? enabledModels : availableModels`, then persists through `chat_update_conversation`.
- Good: main Chat model is text-only while `defaultModels.vision` points at a vision-capable provider; image attachments become a textual `[Mixer vision auxiliary result]` block for the main model.
- Good: main Chat model is `deepseek-v4-flash` and Mixer vision is `auto`; image attachments are pre-analyzed by an enabled `vision=true` model such as `gpt-4o` instead of being sent directly to DeepSeek.
- Bad: implementing Mixer as multiple simultaneous answer lanes, voting, synthesis, or aggregator records. Mixer is per-task model routing only.
- Good: multiple quick clicks on "新建聊天" settle on one blank `Conversation` until the user sends a message or switches to a different provider/model/folder/assistant scope.
- Base: `#chat` shows the empty Chat shell; `#chat/{id}` loads the referenced conversation.
- Good: `deepseek-v4-flash` without a manual override resolves its context window from the built-in model database, so Settings and Chat context usage agree on 1,048,576 tokens.
- Bad: listening for `{ kind: 'chunk', text }` on `chat-stream`; backend emits `delta` and `done`, not `text`.
- Bad: creating a new blank conversation on every click just because the current route is `#chat`; this floods storage and sidebar with empty "新对话" rows.
- Bad: adding `chat.userDisplayName` to Settings UI and Rust `ChatConfig` but forgetting `normalizeSettings`, causing the field to disappear immediately after save.

### 6. Tests Required
- `npm run typecheck` must catch mismatches between bridge types and Chat UI props.
- `npm run lint` must pass without `any` stream payload listeners.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must include settings fallback assertions when changing chat defaults or auxiliary model slots, and title-generation regression tests when changing title summary behavior.
- Manual/UI smoke must cover repeated New Chat clicks and composer focus when changing Chat shell or InputBar focus behavior.
- `npm run build:ui` must pass after route or lazy-loaded Chat component changes.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```tsx
listen<any>('chat-stream', (event) => {
  if (event.payload.kind === 'chunk') {
    setStreamingContent((prev) => prev + event.payload.text)
  }
})
```

#### Correct
```tsx
api.onChatStream((payload) => {
  if (payload.delta) {
    setStreamingContent((prev) => prev + payload.delta)
  }
  if (payload.done) {
    setStreaming(false)
  }
})
```

#### Wrong
```tsx
// Lets each click race into a fresh backend create.
const conv = await chatApi.createConversation(providerId, model, folder)
applyConversation(conv)
```

#### Correct
```tsx
if (canReuseCurrentBlankConversation()) {
  applyConversation(currentBlankConversation)
  syncConversationRoute(currentBlankConversation.id)
  return
}
const conv = await singleInFlightCreateConversationRequest
applyConversation(conv)
```

## Scenario: Chat Assistant Suite Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Assistant suite work spans `src/chat/types.ts`, `src/chat/api.ts`, `src/chat/AssistantCenter.tsx`, `src-tauri/src/chat/types.rs`, assistant storage, conversation snapshots, and agent prompt/tool preparation.
- Apply this contract whenever changing assistant center UI, assistant storage fields, default assistants, assistant snapshots, or assistant-driven tool behavior.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_get_assistants(includeArchived?: boolean) -> { success: true, assistants: ChatAssistant[] }`
- `chat_create_assistant(assistant: ChatAssistant) -> { success: true, assistant: ChatAssistant }`
- `chat_update_assistant(assistant: ChatAssistant) -> { success: true, assistant: ChatAssistant }`
- `chat_create_conversation(..., assistantId?: string) -> Conversation.assistant_snapshot: ChatAssistantSnapshot`
- `ChatAssistant.quick_commands: AssistantQuickCommand[]`
- `ChatAssistant.data_connectors: AssistantDataConnector[]`
- `ChatAssistant.knowledge_skills: AssistantKnowledgeSkill[]`

### 3. Contracts
- Stored Rust assistant fields remain snake_case. Frontend types may include camelCase aliases for legacy/browser compatibility, but new persisted fields must be written as snake_case.
- The suite center must not add an independent internal sidebar. Chat's outer sidebar is the only navigation sidebar; assistant list/detail/edit are main-content page states.
- Built-in assistants are upgradeable templates. When default built-ins gain new suite fields, backend storage and browser mock storage must hydrate missing empty fields for existing built-in records without overwriting non-empty user-edited fields.
- `assistant_snapshot` must include suite runtime fields (`quick_commands`, `data_connectors`, `knowledge_skills`) so old conversations keep the suite behavior that existed when the conversation was created.
- Suite quick commands and knowledge skills must be injected into the runtime system prompt, not displayed only in UI.
- Suite data connectors that declare explicit `tool_ids` or `server_id` must narrow the tool list before active-skill filtering. Connectors without explicit tool scope are descriptive and must not accidentally disable tools.
- Skill runtime tools (`skill_activate`, `skill_read_file`, `skill_run_script`) must remain available when connector filtering is active so bound skills can load themselves.
- Non-ASCII slash commands and skill names need stable local IDs; do not normalize them all to the same ASCII fallback such as `cmd_0`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Missing assistant name -> backend returns `助手名称不能为空`.
- Existing built-in assistant missing new suite arrays -> storage read hydrates defaults and persists the upgraded index.
- Existing built-in assistant with non-empty custom suite arrays -> hydration leaves those arrays unchanged.
- Data connector disabled or unconfigured -> prompt may mention unavailable status, but runtime must not allow its tools through connector filtering.
- Data connector has no `tool_ids` and no `server_id` -> no connector tool filtering occurs.
- Assistant `tool_preset: none` -> clears all tools before connector filtering.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `AssistantCenter` renders plaza tabs/cards in the main content area and detail sections for quick commands, data connectors, and knowledge skills.
- Good: existing `asst_builtin_code_data` stored before suite fields are added is hydrated with Python/file connectors and code/data knowledge skills.
- Good: a connector with `tool_ids: ["run_python"]` keeps `run_python` plus Skill runtime tools and removes unrelated native/MCP tools.
- Base: old conversations missing suite fields deserialize with empty arrays and continue to render/send normally.
- Bad: adding a new suite field only in TypeScript, leaving Rust snapshot/storage defaults behind.
- Bad: using `enabled` to mean installed; installed state belongs to `installed`, while `enabled` controls whether the suite can be used.

### 6. Tests Required
- `npm run typecheck` must cover `ChatAssistant` / `ChatAssistantSnapshot` shape changes across UI and mock API.
- `npm run lint` must pass after assistant center view edits.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must include assistant snapshot struct initializers, connector tool filtering, non-ASCII ID normalization, and built-in hydration behavior when suite fields change.
- `npm run build:ui` must pass after assistant center lazy route or layout changes.
- Manual/browser smoke should cover `#chat/assistants` plaza, detail, edit, no inner sidebar, and old mock/storage data showing non-zero default suite stats after hydration.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```rust
// Every Chinese slash command becomes cmd_0, so React keys and snapshots collide.
command.id = normalize_local_id(&command.slash, "cmd", 0);
```

#### Correct
```rust
// Non-ASCII labels get a stable hash fallback.
command.id = normalize_local_id(&command.slash, "cmd", idx);
```

#### Wrong
```tsx
// "已安装" tab silently hides disabled but installed suites.
if (tab === 'installed' && assistant.enabled === false) return false
```

#### Correct
```tsx
if (tab === 'installed' && assistant.installed === false) return false
```

## Scenario: Chat Runtime Provider Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Chat model calls span Rust request construction, provider adapters, streaming events, conversation JSON replay, settings provider format, and frontend provider settings.
- Apply this contract whenever changing `src-tauri/src/chat/model/**`, `build_chat_api_messages`, `chat_send_message`, provider `api_format`, streaming conversion, or hidden transcript persistence.

### 2. Signatures
- `LanguageModelProvider::generate(request: GenerateRequest) -> Result<GenerateOutput, ModelError>`
- `LanguageModelProvider::stream(request: GenerateRequest, sink: StreamSink) -> Result<GenerateOutput, ModelError>`
- `GenerateRequest { model, system, messages: Vec<ModelMessage>, tools: Vec<ModelTool>, options, metadata }`
- `GenerateOutput { text, reasoning, tool_calls, usage, finish_reason, provider_messages, cancelled }`
- `StreamPart::{TextDelta, ReasoningDelta, ToolCallStart, ToolCallDelta, ToolCallDone, ToolResult, Finish, Error}`
- Provider `api_format` values are normalized to `openai_chat | anthropic_messages | apple_local`; legacy `openai` and `anthropic` must still load.

### 3. Contracts
- Runtime and tool-loop code call provider-agnostic model APIs. It must not build `/chat/completions` or `/messages` JSON bodies directly.
- Provider-specific wire details stay inside provider adapters: `OpenAiChatProvider` owns OpenAI chat JSON/SSE/tool calls; `AnthropicMessagesProvider` owns Claude Messages content blocks/SSE/tool_use/tool_result; `AppleLocalProvider` owns local text-only calls.
- Conversation JSON may keep legacy `api_messages`, but new assistant replies should also persist canonical `model_messages`. Replay prefers `model_messages`; old conversations missing it fall back to `api_messages`.
- `api_messages` remains an OpenAI-compatible compatibility mirror for older replay/debug paths. It is not the internal runtime contract.
- `supports_tools` is only a settings compatibility flag. Runtime capability decisions should use provider capabilities when that path is available, especially for tools, vision, streaming, and reasoning.
- Existing Tauri event payloads remain stable: provider stream parts are converted into current `chat-stream`, `chat-tool`, and `chat-context` payloads at the runtime/event boundary.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Legacy provider `api_format: "anthropic"` -> sanitize/load as `anthropic_messages`.
- Legacy provider `api_format: "openai"` or unknown string -> sanitize/load as `openai_chat` unless the base URL is Apple local.
- Apple local provider selected with tools or vision -> tools are not sent; plain text flow remains usable.
- Old assistant message missing `model_messages` but containing `api_messages` -> replay from sanitized `api_messages`.
- Provider stream emits an error part -> backend emits/returns a Chat stream error without corrupting conversation history.
- Provider rejects tools -> existing provider-without-tools fallback behavior is preserved for plain Chat and prompt-only Skill use.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `commands.rs` builds a `GenerateRequest`, dispatches by `provider.api_format_kind()`, and consumes `GenerateOutput`.
- Good: Anthropic image input becomes Claude `content` image blocks; Claude tool calls become `tool_use` / `tool_result` blocks inside `AnthropicMessagesProvider`.
- Base: an OpenAI-compatible provider with no tools behaves as before through `OpenAiChatProvider`.
- Bad: adding `if provider.api_format == "anthropic"` branches in `commands.rs` that manually assemble Claude JSON.
- Bad: storing only visible assistant text after a tool loop; strict providers need canonical or compatibility transcript replay.

### 6. Tests Required
- Rust provider adapter tests must cover OpenAI text/tool/stream chunks and Anthropic text/image/tool_use/tool_result/stream events.
- Rust compatibility tests must cover legacy `api_messages` replay and legacy provider `api_format` normalization.
- `npm run typecheck` must cover frontend provider format fields and `ChatMessage.model_messages` compatibility fields.
- `npm run lint` and `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must pass after provider/runtime changes.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```rust
// Runtime code should not know Claude's wire shape.
if provider.api_format == "anthropic" {
    body["messages"] = convert_messages_to_anthropic(&messages);
    body["tools"] = convert_tools_to_anthropic(&tools);
}
```

#### Correct
```rust
let request = generate_request_from_openai_messages(model, messages, tools, options, "Chat API");
let output = generate_with_chat_provider(state, provider, retry_attempts, request).await?;
let message = output.to_openai_compatible_message();
```

#### Wrong
```rust
// Drops the canonical replay path for newer conversations.
if !message.api_messages.is_empty() {
    messages.extend(message.api_messages.iter().map(sanitize_api_message_for_model));
}
```

#### Correct
```rust
if !message.model_messages.is_empty() {
    messages.extend(openai_messages_from_model_messages(&message.model_messages));
} else if !message.api_messages.is_empty() {
    messages.extend(message.api_messages.iter().map(sanitize_api_message_for_model));
}
```

## Scenario: Chat Agent Runtime

> **Product spec**: [docs/CHAT_AGENT_RUNTIME_PRD.md](../../../docs/CHAT_AGENT_RUNTIME_PRD.md) (v1.1). State machine and lifecycle: PRD §6.1. Implement `src-tauri/src/chat/agent/` per that PRD.

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Changes to multi-step tool loop, `complete_assistant_reply`, `run_agent_loop`, step/stop/prepare/finish, `AgentHost`, or extraction from `commands.rs`.
- Applies to `chat_send_message` and `chat_regenerate_message` (both use `complete_assistant_reply`). Apple local provider stays a pre-agent shortcut in `commands.rs`.

### 2. Signatures (target, Phase B+)
- `run_agent_loop(config: AgentRunConfig, host: &dyn AgentHost, executor: &dyn ToolExecutor) -> Result<AgentRunResult, String>`
- `AgentRunEntry`: `send` | `regenerate`
- `prepare_agent_step(input: PrepareStepInput) -> PreparedStep`
- `evaluate_stop_after_model_step` / tool-loop exit per PRD §6.1
- `on_model_step_finish` then `on_tool_batch_finish` -> `AgentStepResult`
- `ToolExecutor::call(ctx, tool, arguments, skill_cache) -> Result<McpToolCallResult, String>`
- `AgentPhase`: `tool_loop` | `synthesis` | `plain`
- `AgentStreamPolicy`: `planning_no_done_until_no_tools` | `synthesis_always_done` | `synthesis_defer_empty`

### 3. Contracts
- `chat/agent` must not depend on `chat/commands.rs`; use `AgentHost` for emit, approval, and generation checks.
- Agent code must call models only via `generate_with_chat_provider` / `stream_with_chat_provider` and `GenerateRequest`; no provider JSON in `agent/`.
- Tool execution must go through `ToolExecutor` (default: registry adapter), not duplicate MCP/native/skill branches inside `loop_.rs`.
- **Natural stop**: After `extract_tool_calls` and `pending_tool_calls_from_dsml` are both empty, finalize with that assistant output; do not run `synthesis` for the same user turn.
- **Step limit**: When tool loop exhausts `max_tool_rounds` without natural stop, inject the existing system message then run `synthesis` without tools.
- **Plain**: When `active_tools` is empty, skip tool loop and run `synthesis` only (same as today when `tools.is_empty()`).
- **Cancelled**: Respect `run_generation` / `wait_for_chat_cancel`; emit `chat-stream` done `cancelled` with stable `runId`.
- Tauri event payloads unchanged; Agent converts `StreamPart` in stream adapter only.
- Persisted `model_messages` / `api_messages` rules stay identical to Chat MCP + Skill scenario below.
- `chatTools.parallelToolCallsInStep` (Phase C): default `false`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Tools enabled but provider rejects tools -> existing skill-only then plain fallback; Agent must not panic.
- Unknown tool name / invalid arguments JSON -> same as today.
- Provider tools unsupported mid-run -> `ProviderToolsUnsupported`; fall back then synthesis.
- DSML in streamed content -> parse before natural-stop check; no premature planning `done` when tools pending.
- Tool loop produced persisted tool results, but final synthesis stream/API returns empty visible text -> Agent must preserve the run by emitting and storing a localized fallback assistant reply with the tool records and hidden transcript; plain no-tool empty responses still fail and may roll back the user message.
- Regenerate path -> same agent loop semantics as send.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `commands` implements `AgentHost`, builds `AgentRunConfig`, calls `run_agent_loop`; persistence stays in commands.
- Good: `prepare_agent_step` centralizes skill filter + assistant preset + capability checks.
- Good: `SynthesisDeferEmpty` is used only after tool records exist, so a model that executed tools but failed to summarize does not make the whole user turn disappear after reload.
- Bad: `agent/` imports `commands` or calls `emit_*` without `AgentHost`.
- Bad: Second synthesis request after natural stop with no tool_calls.
- Bad: Treating every empty synthesis as recoverable; plain no-tool empty replies are still provider failures.

### 6. Tests Required
- Rust tests in `src-tauri/src/chat/agent/` (stop, prepare; mocks for `ToolExecutor` / `AgentHost`).
- Rust stream policy tests must cover `SynthesisDeferEmpty`: empty output validates without emitting `done`, while non-empty output still emits normal `done`.
- Regression: PRD §10.2 manual smoke (12 items) before merging Phase B.
- Phase B gate: PRD §12.2 normalize checklist unless documented exception.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` after Agent changes.

## Scenario: Chat MCP + Skill Cross-Layer Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Chat MCP + Skill work changes model request construction, Tauri command payloads, streaming events, conversation JSON persistence, settings JSON persistence, and Chat UI rendering.
- Apply this contract whenever implementing Chat Tool Runtime, MCP server settings, Skill selection/loading, or tool-call persistence.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_send_message(conversationId: string, content: string, attachments: string[], activeSkillId?: string) -> { success: boolean, conversation?: Conversation, error?: string }`
- `chat_mcp_list_tools() -> { success: boolean, tools?: ChatToolDefinition[], error?: string }`
- `chat_mcp_test_server(server: ChatMcpServer) -> { success: boolean, tools?: ChatToolDefinition[], error?: string }`
- `chat_skills_list() -> { success: boolean, skills?: SkillMeta[], error?: string }`
- `chat_skills_read(skillId: string) -> { success: boolean, skill?: SkillDetail, error?: string }`
- `chat-stream` event payload: `{ conversationId, runId, messageId?, kind, delta, reasoningDelta?, done?, reason?, full? }`.
- `chat-tool` event payload: `{ conversationId, runId, messageId?, toolCallId, name, source, serverId?, status, argumentsPreview?, resultPreview?, error?, startedAt?, completedAt?, durationMs? }`.

### 3. Contracts
- Settings JSON remains camelCase. Add new settings under one Chat tools block such as `chatTools`, not as many unrelated top-level fields.
- Conversation JSON remains Rust snake_case. Persist conversation-level Skill as `active_skill_id`; persist assistant tool traces as message `tool_calls`.
- Strict tool-calling provider transcript is stored separately from the visible timeline. When an assistant response includes tool calls, persist message `api_messages` with the raw assistant `tool_calls` message, each matching `role: "tool"` result, and the final assistant message.
- Preserve provider reasoning payloads only in the hidden transcript when protocol replay requires them. DeepSeek thinking-mode tool calls need `reasoning_content` replayed with the assistant tool-call message; plain no-tool answers should not create hidden `api_messages`.
- Frontend TypeScript converts persisted snake_case fields at the bridge/type boundary or explicitly models existing snake_case fields, matching current Chat conventions.
- Tool traces are metadata on the related assistant message, not standalone `role: 'tool'` timeline messages in the UI.
- Skill selection is conversation-pinned and user-switchable. Sending a message snapshots the active Skill ID onto the generated assistant message.
- Claude-style Skills use progressive loading: list metadata in the catalog, load `SKILL.md` through `skill_activate`, read supporting files through `skill_read_file`, and run bundled scripts through `skill_run_script`.
- `chat_skills_list` is a catalog/readiness path and should use metadata-only registry discovery. Do not index every bundled supporting file for the list UI; full file indexing belongs to `chat_skills_read`, runtime activation, and tool execution paths.
- Native and Skill runtime tools must expose prompt-facing OpenAI names (`web_search`, `skill_activate`, `skill_read_file`, `skill_run_script`). MCP tools must keep namespaced OpenAI names such as `mcp__server_id__tool_name` to avoid collisions.
- Tool approval policy defaults to read-only tools auto-running and sensitive tools requiring confirmation.
- `skill_run_script` is sensitive by default, only accepts paths under `scripts/`, and must run through the Rust-owned Skill runtime. `skill_activate`, `skill_read_file`, and `web_search` are read-like and may run automatically under the default policy.
- MCP stdio process control is Rust-owned. Frontend must not use `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` to spawn MCP servers or require `shell:*` capability for this feature.
- MCP discovery and invocation follow the protocol boundary: list tools with `tools/list`, invoke with `tools/call`, and return MCP `isError` tool results back to the model as tool content rather than converting them into visible timeline messages.
- Streamable HTTP MCP responses may be `text/event-stream`; backend must read chunks under timeout and accept only the JSON-RPC event whose `id` matches the request, skipping notifications/progress/mismatched responses.
- Native `web_search` is a native tool, not an MCP server, but uses the same UI/event/status model as MCP tools.
- Cancelling a stream or switching conversations must stop the backend generation, ignore stale `chat-stream` / `chat-tool` events by `{ conversationId, runId }`, and keep optimistic user messages scoped to the conversation that sent them.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Missing or disabled MCP config -> no `tools` are sent to the model; Skill-only prompt injection still works.
- Provider lacks or rejects `tools` -> surface a user-visible Chat tool status and disable tool-dependent sends when a selected Skill recommends unavailable tools; do not break plain Chat or prompt-only Skill use.
- Provider returns an assistant message with no `tool_calls` during the tool loop -> finalize that exact assistant response immediately, preserving reasoning. Do not discard it and make a second plain request.
- A model claims in visible text that it used a tool but returned no structured `tool_calls` and no Kivio `chat-tool` result -> treat it as ordinary assistant text, not evidence that a tool ran.
- Active Skill `allowed-tools` filtering -> always retain the internal Skill runtime tools (`skill_activate`, `skill_read_file`, `skill_run_script`) so the selected Skill can load itself.
- Old conversation JSON missing `active_skill_id`, `tool_calls`, or `api_messages` -> deserialize with defaults and render normally.
- MCP server imported from config -> keep disabled until the user explicitly enables it.
- MCP env values shown in UI/logs -> redact secret-looking values; never include full env secrets in tool previews.
- Tool run exceeds max rounds, timeout, or cancellation -> emit final `chat-tool` status and a `chat-stream` completion/error reason with the same `runId`.
- User cancels while request startup or chunk read is pending -> emit `chat-stream` done with `reason: 'cancelled'` promptly and do not rely on the HTTP stream producing another chunk.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `MessageBubble` renders `ToolCallBlock` above assistant content by reading `message.toolCalls`.
- Good: `chat-tool` events patch only the matching `{ conversationId, runId }`, preventing stale events from another run updating the visible conversation.
- Good: stream cancellation is checked while opening the streaming request and again while awaiting each `response.chunk()`; polling only between already-received chunks can leave the UI waiting on a blocked network read.
- Good: pending optimistic user messages are keyed to the conversation that sent them; switching routes during send must not render conversation A's pending user message in conversation B.
- Good: after a tool-assisted response, later model requests replay hidden `api_messages` so OpenAI-compatible providers see the exact `assistant tool_calls -> tool -> assistant` sequence.
- Good: a tools-planning model response with plain text and no structured tool call is stored as the final assistant reply without a second model request.
- Base: a conversation with no Skill and MCP disabled behaves exactly like current Chat.
- Bad: inserting tool results as visible user/assistant messages; this corrupts previews, editing, deletion, and regeneration semantics.
- Bad: using visible assistant text like "I ran the tool" to create tool records; only structured provider tool calls or Kivio tool events can create tool traces.
- Bad: exposing Skill tools as `skill__activate` in the OpenAI schema while the system prompt instructs the model to call `skill_activate`.
- Bad: adding frontend shell permissions so the webview can spawn arbitrary user-configured MCP commands.
- Bad: clearing streaming state on conversation switch but leaving a global `pendingUserMessage`; that leaks the old conversation's optimistic user row into the newly selected conversation.

### 6. Tests Required
- TypeScript typecheck must cover the new `ChatStreamPayload`, `ChatToolProgressPayload`, `ToolCallRecord`, `SkillMeta`, and settings types.
- Rust tests must cover settings defaults/sanitization, old conversation deserialization with missing new fields, tool max-round stopping, timeout/cancel behavior, hidden tool transcript replay, Skill runtime tool naming, sensitive script approval, and tool-result message construction.
- Rust tests must cover the tools-planning no-tool-call finalization path, including empty visible text failure.
- Rust tests for Streamable HTTP MCP must cover notification/progress events before the response and mismatched JSON-RPC ids before the matching id.
- UI smoke tests must cover live tool progress, persisted tool trace rendering after reload, Skill switch/clear persistence, and provider-without-tools fallback.
- Rust regression tests must cover that metadata registry discovery skips bundled file indexing while full registry discovery still includes supporting files.
- Capability review must confirm no frontend `shell:*` permission is added when MCP stdio stays Rust-owned.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```tsx
// Treating tool calls as timeline messages makes reload/edit/regenerate drift.
const messages = [
  ...conversation.messages,
  { id: call.id, role: 'assistant', content: `Called ${call.name}`, timestamp: now },
]
```

#### Correct
```tsx
// Tool calls belong to the assistant response they helped produce.
const nextAssistant: ChatMessage = {
  ...assistant,
  toolCalls: [...(assistant.toolCalls ?? []), toolCallRecord],
}
```

#### Wrong
```rust
// Dropping the provider transcript breaks strict tool callers on the next turn.
messages.push(json!({ "role": "assistant", "content": visible_answer }));
```

#### Correct
```rust
// UI stays clean, while the next API request can replay the strict transcript.
assistant.tool_calls = tool_records;
assistant.api_messages = vec![
    assistant_tool_call_message,
    tool_result_message,
    final_assistant_message,
];
```

## Scenario: Chat Context Management Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Chat context management spans Rust request construction, conversation JSON persistence, Tauri command/event payloads, and React header UI.
- Apply this contract whenever changing context usage indicators, compression summaries, `build_chat_api_messages`, or Chat context popover rendering.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_get_context_stats(conversationId: string) -> { success: true, contextState: ConversationContextState, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat_compress_context(conversationId: string) -> { success: true, contextState: ConversationContextState, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat-context` event payload: `{ conversationId: string, contextState: ConversationContextState }`
- Conversation JSON persists `context_state: ConversationContextState`.

### 3. Contracts
- Context stats are backend-owned because Rust assembles the real prompt with system prompt, runtime context, skills, tool schemas, hidden `api_messages`, attachments, and summary injection.
- Frontend may render persisted `context_state` immediately, but refreshes through `chat_get_context_stats` when the active conversation/model/skill changes.
- Stored Rust fields remain snake_case (`estimated_input_tokens`, `context_window_tokens`, `context_state`); frontend types may include camelCase aliases only for compatibility.
- `ConversationContextState.segments` drives the segmented bar; React must not recompute source buckets from visible messages except in browser-only mocks.
- Image context estimates must not count `image_url` data URLs as text tokens. Count image payloads from provider/model image-token rules and local image dimensions; when `defaultModels.vision` routes the current image turn through Mixer, estimate the main Chat request as text-only with an auxiliary-vision result placeholder instead of direct image parts.
- Compression preserves raw visible messages. It stores `summary`, `source_message_ids`, and `source_until_message_id`, then future requests inject a synthetic summary system message and skip old raw messages before the boundary.
- Compression model selection uses `Settings::effective_compression_model()`, which inherits the effective Chat model when `defaultModels.compression` is unset / auto.
- Auto-compression runs before send when estimated usage crosses the backend threshold and there is no active fresh summary. Manual compression uses the same backend path.
- Context states may include `warning` when auto-compression failed but the uncompressed request is still estimated to fit; the Context popover must display this warning without hiding the visible conversation.
- Editing, deleting, or regenerating a message at or before the summary boundary must mark the summary stale and ignore it in future request construction until recompressed.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Missing conversation file -> command invoke fails; frontend surfaces the error in the Chat error path.
- Not enough old complete messages to compress -> `chat_compress_context` returns a user-visible error and leaves raw messages unchanged.
- Compression provider missing key/model -> compression returns a clear model/key error; normal sends should continue when the original request can still be sent.
- Auto-compression failure before send while still under the estimated window -> backend saves/emits the current context state with `warning` and continues with the uncompressed request.
- Auto-compression failure before send when estimated usage is at/over the model window -> backend removes the newly persisted user message, recomputes/emits `context_state`, and returns a clear error suggesting manual compression or a larger-context model.
- Model call failure after optimistic user message persistence -> backend removes that user message, recomputes `context_state`, emits `chat-context`, and saves the corrected conversation.
- Stale summary present -> request builders ignore the summary and include raw history.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: `ContextIndicator` reads `contextState.segments` and renders the backend-provided source labels, colors, and token estimates.
- Good: `build_chat_api_messages` injects the summary only when it is non-stale and its boundary message still exists.
- Good: visible history stays intact after compression; only future request payloads are shortened.
- Base: a new conversation with no messages shows an estimated/unknown context state and can refresh without failing.
- Bad: deleting old visible messages as the compression mechanism.
- Bad: computing production context usage only from React-visible messages; this misses tool schemas, hidden transcript replay, runtime prompt, and skills.
- Bad: continuing to show a context state that includes a user message after `chat_send_message` rolls that message back on provider failure.

### 6. Tests Required
- TypeScript typecheck must cover `ConversationContextState`, `ContextUsageSegment`, and `chat-context` event payload usage.
- Rust tests must cover token estimation, summary injection, stale-summary ignore behavior, boundary invalidation, and hidden tool transcript replay.
- `npm run build:ui` must pass after context indicator layout or Chat header changes.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must pass after any request-builder or compression-boundary change.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```tsx
const tokens = conversation.messages.reduce((sum, message) => {
  return sum + estimateTokens(message.content)
}, 0)
```

#### Correct
```tsx
const result = await chatApi.getContextStats(conversation.id)
setContextState(result.contextState)
```

#### Wrong
```rust
conversation.messages.drain(..boundary_index);
```

#### Correct
```rust
conversation.context_state.summary = Some(ConversationContextSummary {
    source_until_message_id,
    source_message_ids,
    content: summary_content,
    stale: false,
    ..summary_metadata
});
```

## Scenario: Chat Projects MVP Cross-Layer Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Chat Projects span React sidebar state, browser mock storage, TypeScript Tauri wrappers, Rust Tauri commands, conversation JSON, and a project index JSON file.
- Apply this contract whenever changing `src/chat/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/chat/ConversationList.tsx`, `src/chat/api.ts`, `src/chat/types.ts`, or `src-tauri/src/chat/**` project/folder behavior.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_get_projects() -> { success: true, projects: ChatProject[] }`
- `chat_create_project(name: string, description?: string, color?: string) -> { success: true, project: ChatProject }`
- `chat_update_project(projectId: string, name?: string, description?: string, color?: string) -> { success: true, project: ChatProject }`
- `chat_delete_project(projectId: string) -> { success: true }`
- `chat_get_conversations(offset: usize, limit: usize, folder?: string) -> { success: true, conversations: ConversationListItem[] }`
- `chat_create_conversation(providerId?: string, model?: string, folder?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat_update_conversation(conversationId: string, title?: string, pinned?: boolean, folder?: string, providerId?: string, model?: string, activeSkillId?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`

### 3. Contracts
- MVP project membership is stored as `Conversation.folder`, using the project `name` as the membership key.
- Projects are also persisted independently in `{app_data_dir}/conversations/projects.json` as `ChatProjectIndex`, so empty projects remain visible.
- `ChatProject.id` is backend-owned, starts with `proj_`, and is used for project record updates/deletes. Do not use it as conversation membership until a future explicit migration adds a stable `project_id` field.
- `chat_get_projects` backfills project records from existing non-empty conversation `folder` values for legacy compatibility.
- Creating or updating a project trims the name, rejects empty names, rejects names longer than 80 characters, and rejects duplicate project names.
- Renaming a project must migrate every conversation whose `folder` equals the old project name to the new project name.
- Deleting a project must delete only the project record and move its conversations out of the project by setting `folder` to `None`; it must not delete conversations.
- Frontend removal from a project sends an explicit empty `folder` to Tauri. Omitting `folder` means “do not change membership”; empty string means “remove membership”.
- Browser mock mode must mirror the same create/rename/delete/move semantics in localStorage keys `kivio-chat-dev-projects` and `kivio-chat-dev-conversations`.
- Sidebar project lists must come from persisted projects, not from deriving folders only from visible conversations.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Invalid project ID -> backend returns `Err("Invalid project id: ...")`.
- Missing project ID on update/delete -> backend returns `Err("项目不存在")`.
- Empty project name -> backend/mock throws `项目名称不能为空`.
- Duplicate project name -> backend/mock throws `项目名称已存在`.
- Project name longer than 80 characters -> backend/mock throws `项目名称不能超过 80 个字符`.
- Deleting the selected project -> frontend clears the selected project and current project-scoped conversation view; conversations remain accessible under “全部聊天”.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: create a project, select it, and create a new conversation; the conversation persists with `folder` equal to that project name.
- Good: rename a project from `A` to `B`; both the sidebar project name and all conversations formerly in `A` now use `B`.
- Base: a legacy conversation with `folder: "Research"` appears under an auto-backfilled project named `Research`.
- Bad: deriving the project menu from the currently filtered conversation list; empty projects and projects outside the current scope disappear.
- Bad: sending `undefined` for `folder` when the user clicks “移出项目”; Tauri treats omitted `folder` as “unchanged”.

### 6. Tests Required
- `npm run typecheck` must cover `ChatProject`, project API wrappers, and project props passed through `Sidebar`/`ConversationList`.
- `npm run lint` must pass after project UI changes.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must pass after changing project storage or command signatures.
- `npm run build:ui` must pass after changing the Chat lazy route, sidebar, or project dialog/menu.
- Manual or browser smoke should cover create empty project, project-scoped new chat, move into/out of project, rename migration, and delete without deleting conversations.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```tsx
const projectFolders = conversations
  .map((conversation) => conversation.folder)
  .filter(Boolean)
```

#### Correct
```tsx
const projects = await chatApi.getProjects()
const projectFolders = projects.map((project) => project.name)
```

#### Wrong
```tsx
await chatApi.updateConversation(id, { folder: undefined })
```

#### Correct
```tsx
await chatApi.updateConversation(id, { folder: '' })
```

## Scenario: Chat Assistant Center Cross-Layer Contract

### 1. Scope / Trigger
- Trigger: Assistant Center spans React routing, browser mock storage, TypeScript Tauri wrappers, Rust commands, assistant index JSON storage, conversation JSON, prompt construction, Skill selection, and context stats.
- Apply this contract whenever changing Assistant Center UI, reusable assistant profiles, Chat conversation creation/update, assistant prompt injection, or conversation list metadata.

### 2. Signatures
- `chat_get_assistants() -> { success: true, assistants: ChatAssistant[] }`
- `chat_create_assistant(assistant: ChatAssistant) -> { success: true, assistant: ChatAssistant }`
- `chat_update_assistant(assistant: ChatAssistant) -> { success: true, assistant: ChatAssistant }`
- `chat_duplicate_assistant(assistantId: string) -> { success: true, assistant: ChatAssistant }`
- `chat_delete_assistant(assistantId: string) -> { success: true }`
- `chat_create_conversation(providerId?: string, model?: string, folder?: string, assistantId?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`
- `chat_update_conversation(conversationId: string, ..., activeSkillId?: string, assistantId?: string) -> { success: true, conversation: Conversation }`

### 3. Contracts
- Assistant profiles are reusable configs stored in `{app_data_dir}/conversations/assistants.json` as `ChatAssistantIndex`; conversation history is not stored inside assistant records.
- `ChatAssistant.id` is backend-owned or frontend-generated with the `asst_` prefix. Backend rejects IDs outside `asst_*`.
- Stored Rust fields remain snake_case: `system_prompt`, `provider_id`, `skill_id`, `tool_preset`, `conversation_starters`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- Frontend types may expose camelCase aliases only for compatibility, but Tauri command arguments remain camelCase (`assistantId`, `providerId`, `activeSkillId`).
- Creating a conversation with an assistant stores both `assistant_id` and `assistant_snapshot` on `Conversation`. The snapshot freezes assistant name, description, system prompt, provider/model override, Skill, tool preset, greeting, and starters for that conversation.
- Editing an assistant must not silently mutate older conversation behavior. Request construction uses the conversation's `assistant_snapshot`, not the latest assistant profile.
- Assistant provider/model override is only a default at conversation creation. Later user model changes persist through normal `chat_update_conversation` provider/model fields.
- Assistant Skill is applied as the conversation default `active_skill_id`; explicit per-send `activeSkillId` can still override where supported.
- Assistant `tool_preset` is runtime behavior, not only UI metadata: `inherit` follows the global Chat tool settings, `all` uses all globally enabled/available tools, `skills` keeps only Skill runtime tools (`source == "skill"`), and `none` sends no model tools. When an active assistant Skill has no tools available because of provider limits or `tool_preset: 'none'`, request construction switches progressive Skill loading to SKILL.md-only prompt injection.
- Clearing an assistant sends `assistantId: ''`, clears `assistant_id`, `assistant_snapshot`, and the assistant-provided `active_skill_id`.
- Assistant Center route is `#chat/assistants`; it must not be parsed as a conversation ID.
- Conversation list items include `assistant_id` and `assistant_name` so the sidebar can identify assistant-launched chats.
- Browser mock mode mirrors assistant CRUD and assistant conversation binding in localStorage key `kivio-chat-dev-assistants`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix
- Invalid assistant ID -> backend returns `Err("Invalid assistant id: ...")`.
- Missing assistant on update/duplicate/delete -> backend/mock returns `助手不存在`.
- Empty assistant name -> backend/mock returns `助手名称不能为空`.
- Duplicate active assistant name -> backend/mock returns `助手名称已存在`.
- Assistant name longer than 64 chars -> backend returns `助手名称不能超过 64 个字符`.
- Assistant description longer than 240 chars -> backend returns `助手描述不能超过 240 个字符`.
- Archived or disabled assistant used to create/switch conversation -> backend returns `助手不可用`.
- `assistantId` omitted from `chat_update_conversation` -> assistant binding is unchanged; empty string explicitly clears it.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases
- Good: duplicate a built-in assistant, edit the copy, start a chat; the new conversation has `assistant_id` and `assistant_snapshot`.
- Good: edit an assistant after starting a chat; old chat still uses the stored snapshot while new chats use the updated profile.
- Good: opening `#chat/assistants` renders Assistant Center and leaves the current conversation state available for return/apply.
- Base: a conversation without `assistant_id` behaves like normal Chat.
- Bad: reading the latest assistant profile during `chat_send_message`; that makes old conversations drift when the assistant is edited.
- Bad: sending `undefined` to clear an assistant; omitted means unchanged, `''` means clear.
- Bad: routing `chat/assistants` through `getRouteConversationId()` and attempting to load it as `conv_*`.

### 6. Tests Required
- `npm run typecheck` must cover `ChatAssistant`, `ChatAssistantSnapshot`, assistant API wrappers, Assistant Center props, and conversation/list fields.
- `npm run lint` must pass after Assistant Center UI changes.
- `npm run build:ui` must pass after Assistant Center route or Chat lazy route changes.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` must pass after assistant storage, prompt construction, or command signature changes.
- Browser/manual smoke should cover opening `#chat/assistants`, creating/editing/duplicating/deleting an assistant, starting an assistant chat, switching/clearing the current conversation assistant, and verifying the sidebar assistant label.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```tsx
await chatApi.updateConversation(conversation.id, { assistantId: undefined })
```

#### Correct
```tsx
await chatApi.updateConversation(conversation.id, { assistantId: '' })
```

#### Wrong
```rust
// Re-resolving the assistant profile during send makes history behavior drift.
let assistant = get_assistant(app, conversation.assistant_id.as_deref().unwrap())?;
```

#### Correct
```rust
// Use the frozen snapshot stored on the conversation.
let assistant_snapshot = conversation.assistant_snapshot.as_ref();
```
