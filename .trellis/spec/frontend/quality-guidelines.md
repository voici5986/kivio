Document your project's quality standards here.

Questions to answer:
- What patterns are forbidden?
- What linting rules do you enforce?
- What are your testing requirements?

## Required Patterns

<!-- Patterns that must always be used -->

### Chat motion utilities

- Keep routine Chat interaction motion centralized in `src/index.css` as reusable `chat-motion-*` utilities.
- Prefer applying those classes from Chat components over adding component-local keyframes or animation libraries.
- Always include a `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback when adding a new Chat animation utility.
- Use small entrance/reveal motions for state continuity; do not change Chat routing, persistence, or streaming data flow to support cosmetic motion.
- Streaming Chat scroll-follow must account for real content size changes, not only React data changes. When the user is still pinned to the bottom, observe the message-list inner content size and scroll again after late layout changes from reasoning Markdown, collapse animations, images, or tool blocks.
- User intent wins over scroll-follow: upward wheel/scroll must disable auto-follow until the user returns near the bottom.

### Chat Markdown rendering

- Keep Chat message Markdown rendering on the eager Chat load path. `MessageBubble` should statically import `ChatMarkdown` so conversation history and first assistant content render with Markdown immediately.
- Do not lazy-load `ChatMarkdown` at the individual message boundary just to reduce the Chat chunk size. A plain-text fallback flash is worse for the Chat client than the bundle-size win.
- Markdown parser optimizations should target memoization, normalized input stability, and avoiding unnecessary historical-message rerenders.
- Render assistant reasoning text through `ChatMarkdown` too, using a compact reasoning variant instead of raw `whitespace-pre-wrap` text. Model reasoning often includes Markdown lists, paths, and inline code, and it must not expose raw backticks in the UI.
- Tailwind Typography adds visual backticks around inline `code` via pseudo-elements by default. Chat Markdown containers must disable `code::before` and `code::after` content and use explicit inline-code styling instead.
- Render fenced code blocks with a Chat-specific `not-prose` component instead of Tailwind Typography's default dark `pre`. Code blocks should use a light card surface, compact inline language label, copy action, horizontal overflow, and lightweight syntax coloring without adding a large highlighting dependency unless the product explicitly accepts the bundle cost.

### Chat agent todo UI

- Render the persistent agent todo state as a compact Chat titlebar indicator with a popover for the full list.
- Do not render agent todo state as a sticky panel inside the message list. The message stream should remain the chronological conversation, not the assistant's current workspace dashboard.
- Keep `todo_write` and `todo_update` tool calls in the assistant timeline as historical trace entries, but summarize their arguments/results compactly instead of showing the full todo state payload by default.

### Tauri window lifecycle

- Keep Tauri window labels scoped to one user-facing surface: `main` is the input translator, `chat` is the AI client, `settings` is the standalone settings page, and `lens` is the capture/vision overlay.
- Do not reuse `main` as a generic route container for Chat or Settings. Heavy or infrequently used views should get their own `WebviewWindow` label so closing the view can destroy its WebView process.
- Except for `lens`, close buttons and Esc handlers should close the current window instead of hiding it. Hiding keeps the WebView resident and can keep WebView2/WKWebView renderer memory alive in the background.
- `lens` is the explicit exception because capture selection needs fast reuse and has special temporary-image cleanup behavior.
- When adding a new top-level view, wire the route, Tauri command/event target, and window label together. Avoid broadcasting route-change events to unrelated windows.
- Windows frameless Chat must not use a transparent shell gutter or native window shadow. On Windows, WebView transparent regions can reveal the native window rectangle as a second outer frame; keep the Chat shell flush with the window bounds and use only the inner CSS border/radius for the visible edge. Window minimum sizes and default sizes should reflect the visible Chat content area directly: 400/640 x 400 minimum and 1280 x 800 default contracts.
- Do not enable native shadows globally for Lens. On Windows, Lens can keep a full-screen transparent window and crop visible regions with platform APIs, so native undecorated shadow can create unwanted full-screen edge artifacts. Use CSS borders/shadows on Lens floating cards instead, and keep the select overlay visually borderless.

### Pyodide image/chart execution

- When `run_python` code imports `matplotlib`, force the `Agg` backend before running user code.
- Warm up `matplotlib.pyplot` once before the real execution so first-run backend initialization errors do not leak into the visible tool log.
- If the initial `matplotlib` execution still fails with a Pyodide/wasm/backend-style error, retry once inside the sandbox before surfacing a user-visible failure.
- Save generated images to relative filenames inside the Pyodide filesystem and let Kivio capture them as artifacts; do not require the model to print base64.

### Pyodide sandbox package boundary

- Treat `run_python` as a Pyodide/browser sandbox, not as host Python.
- The security boundary is host filesystem access: sandboxed Python must not read or write `/Users`, app resources, or other host paths.
- Compatible packages may be downloaded inside the Pyodide sandbox with `micropip`; do not describe `run_python` as completely networkless.
- Prefer bundled/local Pyodide packages first, then sandbox-local `micropip` fallback for missing imports.
- Do not use `run_command`, host `pip`, or `python -m pip` to work around sandbox package failures unless the user explicitly asks to modify the host Python environment.
- When `run_python` needs to analyze Kivio attachment safe copies, pass safe-copy paths through the tool's `files` argument. Rust validates and reads only approved chat-attachment/temp inputs, the frontend mounts them in Pyodide, and Python code must read the virtual paths from `KIVIO_INPUT_FILES`.
- Keep Rust tool descriptions, system prompts, and frontend runner behavior consistent when changing this boundary.

### Release packaging for document Skills

- Bundling `pdf`, `docx`, and `xlsx` Skills means bundling their execution runtime too; `SKILL.md` files alone are not a complete release.
- Production installers must include Pyodide core files, `python_stdlib.zip`, and local wheels for common packages used by document/data workflows: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `sympy`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `pillow`, `seaborn`, and `micropip`.
- `run_python` package loading must prefer packaged local resources. CDN loading may exist as a fallback only, not as the normal required path for document analysis.
- Release verification must inspect the final DMG / MSI / NSIS artifacts and confirm that both `skills/pdf|docx|xlsx` and the Python/Pyodide runtime package files are present in the installed app resources.
- The canonical release checklist lives in `docs/RELEASE_PACKAGING.md`; update it whenever the packaging flow changes.
