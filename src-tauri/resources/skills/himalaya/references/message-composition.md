# Message Composition with MML (MIME Meta Language)

Himalaya uses MML for composing emails. MML is a simple XML-based syntax that compiles to MIME messages.

## Basic Message Structure

An email message is a list of **headers** followed by a **body**, separated by a blank line:

```
From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Hello World

This is the message body.
```

## Headers

Common headers:

- `From`: Sender address
- `To`: Primary recipient(s)
- `Cc`: Carbon copy recipients
- `Bcc`: Blind carbon copy recipients
- `Subject`: Message subject
- `Reply-To`: Address for replies (if different from From)
- `In-Reply-To`: Message ID being replied to

### Address Formats

```
To: user@example.com
To: John Doe <john@example.com>
To: "John Doe" <john@example.com>
To: user1@example.com, user2@example.com, "Jane" <jane@example.com>
```

## Plain Text Body

Simple plain text email:

```
From: alice@localhost
To: bob@localhost
Subject: Plain Text Example

Hello, this is a plain text email.

Best,
Alice
```

## MML for Rich Emails

### Multipart Messages

Alternative text/html parts:

```
From: alice@localhost
To: bob@localhost
Subject: Multipart Example

<#multipart type=alternative>
This is the plain text version.
<#part type=text/html>
<html><body><h1>This is the HTML version</h1></body></html>
<#/multipart>
```

### Attachments

```
From: alice@localhost
To: bob@localhost
Subject: With Attachment

Here is the document.

<#part filename=/path/to/document.pdf><#/part>
```

### Mixed Content (Text + Attachments)

```
From: alice@localhost
To: bob@localhost
Subject: Mixed Content

<#multipart type=mixed>
<#part type=text/plain>
Please find the attached files.
<#part filename=/path/to/file1.pdf><#/part>
<#/multipart>
```

## Composing from CLI

```bash
himalaya message write
himalaya message reply 42
himalaya message forward 42
cat message.txt | himalaya template send
```

Save and exit the editor to send; exit without saving to cancel.
